 The Skabeyevas thrive in an environment that is full of suspicion and fear of people from other countries.	The Skabeyevas thrive in an atmosphere of conspiracy and xenophobia.
 In China, the government asked state-owned enterprises and local-government financing vehicles (which invest in infrastructure and other civic projects) to borrow money from China's banks.	In China, by contrast, state-owned enterprises and local-government financing vehicles (which invest in infrastructure and other civic projects) borrowed eagerly from China’s banks at the government’s behest.
 However, the White House and mainstream media will attempt to avoid discussion of this type.	But the White House and mainstream media will try to avoid that kind of conversation.
 A lot of the great work was done without getting paid for it since the people were too poor to pay for it.	A great deal of that admirable work was not paid for; the people could not afford to pay for it.
"
Glahn from American Experiment discovered that Feeding Our Future had 312 approved sites that were each able to serve a maximum of 126,000 children. This means there were a lot of hungry Somali kids being helped by the program."	Glahn in American Experiment found that, “Feeding Our Future had 312 authorized sites for the program, approved for a maximum of 126,000 children.” That’s a lot of hungry Somali kids.
 When will the next version of the virus be immune to the vaccine?	So, when is the next variant that will evade this vaccine too?
 The people collectively own the public credit, and can do whatever they want with it.	Public credit belongs to the people as a whole and they may do anything with it they like.
 People have an inclination to do the opposite of what they should because they do not want to take responsibility for their actions.	The basis of this paradoxical inclination is the lack of personal will, and this lack of personal will itself comes from the horror of responsibility
 The effectiveness of a vaccine is not measured by the vaccine itself.	Vaccine effectiveness is NOT a measure of the effectiveness of a vaccine.
 If we organized the government in a more efficient way, we would be able to have the same amount of government services while spending less money.	Certainly if the structure of government were rationalized, we could easily have as much government as before for less money.
 During difficult times, the amount of money that the government takes from the nation's total income will increase in an unusual way.	Thus, in bad times like these, the proportion of the total national income absorbed by government will rise in a special manner.
 It is a way of manipulating someone's thoughts and beliefs.	It’s a kind of brainwashing.
 No, of course not.	Of course not.
 This Bill does not offer any assurance; instead, we are being asked to trust the multi-millionaire landlord or former oil executive who gets the ministerial position.	There is nothing in this Bill that does this; instead, we are being invited to put out trust whichever multi-millionaire landlord or former oil executive gets given the ministerial position.
 The answer is easy to understand.	The explanation is simple.
 Despite this, many of the 3.1 million teachers in the country's public schools are no longer satisfied with their job.	Still, many of the nation's 3.1 million public-school teachers have become deeply disenchanted with the profession.
 Corporate shareholders were expected to show their appreciation for this incredible gift by keeping the interests of society in mind when making decisions, not just the interests of shareholders.	In return for this extraordinary gift, corporate shareholders owed an implicit obligation back to society: namely, that corporations ought to consider not only shareholder interests but broader societal interests when making decisions.
 No matter if this proposed agreement is accepted or not, there will still be major problems with the railroad system.	Regardless of whether this tentative agreement is approved or not, deep issues with the rail system will remain.
 All the government budgets will be in a good financial state.	All the public treasuries will be rich.
 What are the political and social forces right now that are using the national income to fund government activities, like increasing taxes?	Let it be asked: What are the political and social forces now acting to absorb the national income for purposes of government—acting, that is, to increase taxation?
" For years, politicians and the press have been talking about different missions, places being ""left behind,"" and the ""red wall"" being important, when it has all been shown to be empty campaign promises. The Tory party and the press kept talking about it as if they had a plan to end the stagnation, even though it was clearly nonsense and the Tory party is responsible for the stagnation."	Years of talk about missions, ‘left behind’ places, the ‘red wall’—all of this has been shown to be electoral hot air, always plainly nonsense but something the Tories and the press went along with anyway in order to pretend they actually had some sort of plan to end the stagnation for which they are responsible.
 The negative side effect of stakeholder capitalism is that it takes power away from the citizens of nations and gives it to its associated stakeholders. To fix this, stakeholder capitalism should return the power back to the citizens of nations.	This is the great negative externality of stakeholder capitalism, and one that it ought to internalise by returning political power from its nebulous “stakeholders” back to citizens of nations.
 If these ideas are accepted and work, then the government will have a much greater ability to extend its power.	If only such ideas as these now current do prevail, and if they work, we shall have enormously increased the power of self-extension which is already inherent in government.
 The story is extremely impressive because of the enormous size of the fraud.	The story is mindblowing for the sheer scale of the fraud.
 However, all of that changed when the war in Ukraine started.	But all that has gone out of the window since the Ukraine war began.
 The way our society deals with important issues such as climate change and racial inequality is more strongly affected by the orders of rich business people at Davos than by the opinions of regular people in their local communities.	And our society’s approach to addressing important social questions such as climate change and racial inequity are more heavily influenced by the dictates of corporate chiefs in Davos than they are by the voices of everyday citizens in the public square.
" Surprisingly, the government newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta defended the world leaders who were not given the respect they deserved by the decision to make them travel to the funeral on buses instead of in their motorcades, and called this a ""gross violation of diplomatic protocol""."	Indeed, government newspaper Rossiskaya Gazetarather improbably stood up for the poor, neglected heads of state, complaining that the decision ‘to force world leaders to go to the funeral not in their motorcades but on special buses’ was a ‘gross violation of diplomatic protocol.’
 Although there have been many advertisements trying to convince people that they need to get booster shots to maintain their immunity, it is actually not possible for the Covid-19 vaccine to become less effective.	Despite a mass media campaign to make you believe getting a booster is essential to “top up your immunity” due to declining effectiveness, it is actually impossible for vaccine effectiveness to wane when it comes to the Covid-19 injections.
 The media outlets owned by the people in power just announced that there is a new strain of COVID-19 spreading, as the autumn season begins.	The ruling class’s propaganda outlets just announced there is a brand new COVID variant moving around, just in time for autumn.
 China usually does not accept unsatisfactory results.	It is not like China to settle for such underperformance.
 No one type of government is better than any other, and there is no set way to manage wealth, but it is extremely risky to follow this path without a plan for the type of government it will create and what will happen to people's money.	No particular kind of state is sacred, nor is any particular doctrine of wealth, but it is all the more dangerous to be going this road with no theory of either the kind of state it leads to or what shall be the status of private wealth within it.
 Interstate 93 in Boston is racially oppressive in that it separates Roxbury from South Boston, which is where a lot of racists live, and where there is special, magical dirt that makes South Boston a great place to live and be out at night, unlike Roxbury. Additionally, it limits access to South Boston beaches, which is unjust because black people should be able to swim there too.	I-93 in Boston is kind of a racist road in that it skirts Roxbury and cuts it off from the terrible racists in South Boston and all the South Boston magic dirt which makes Southie perfectly great to live in and walk around in at 2 AM (unlike Roxbury) and access to the South Boston beaches, which is bad because we know that black people like to swim.
 According to the draft bill, the Secretary of State can decide when to put these NDMPs into effect.	These NDMPs, according to the draft bill, can be implemented at the Secretary of State’s whim.
 If we depend on the government for financial aid, it will negatively affect businesses, banks, industries, and farms, as well as any other private ventures.	But taking refuge in public credit will cause that same infection to attack business, banking, industry, agriculture, the entire body of private enterprise.
 Even though local far-right activists have quietly accepted Belgrade Pride (which is a small event) happening each year, their opposition to EuroPride shows that the social attitudes have not changed much since 2001.	And while local far-right activists appear to have quietly accepted defeat over Belgrade Pride, a tame and small-scale annual event, the ferocity of their opposition to EuroPride reveals that social attitudes are not much different from 2001.
 The coronavirus pandemic and politics are two main topics of discussion.	The pandemic and politics are two primary factors.
 They no longer lead the world in solving the problems caused by a recession.	Gone are the days when they led the world in recession-busting
 The new policy makes it difficult to distinguish between illegal aliens, aliens who are legally present in the United States, and U.S. citizens, which has been a goal of those who support less restrictive immigration policies.	The new policy helps to blur the line between illegal aliens, lawfully present aliens, and U.S. citizens, which has long been a goal of the open-borders Left.
 Why shouldn't everyone pay an income tax?	Why should not everyone pay an income tax?
 The current Reconstruction Finance Corporation was created to recreate the power it once had during times of peace.	The present Reconstruction Finance Corporation is a revival of that power in time of peace.
 No government ever wants to reduce its own power.	No government ever wants less government—that is, less of itself.
 The excessive spending by different branches of the government resulted in too much capacity, an imbalanced production pattern, and high levels of debt.	Torrential spending by the many arms of the state left behind excess capacity, a skewed pattern of production and heavy debts.
 I am very impressed.	And I really mean impressive.
 The Left wants people to think that the large number of undocumented immigrants who have come to the United States because of their immigration reforms are normal and should be accepted.	The Left aims to make the hordes of illegal aliens their various so-called immigration reforms have unleashed on their fellow Americans over the years seem normal and acceptable.
 Data from the UK Government, the US Government, and other sources sadly confirms the same findings.	And real-world data supplied by the UK Government, the US government, and others, unfortunately, shows the exact same thing.
 Companies would be able to spend the money more efficiently if they had a better understanding than the government.	That could be more efficient, if companies know better than the government how to spend the money.
" White House officials have bragged about their successes in reducing the amount of paperwork needed in order to supply drugs through a program known as ""compassionate use""."	White House officials have touted their efforts to cut down on the paperwork in order to get the drug through this so-called “compassionate use” channel.
 As I waited for someone to disagree with my point, something interesting occurred; the main supporters of stakeholder capitalism claimed that stakeholder capitalism was actually the same as regular capitalism.	But as I awaited a rebuttal to my argument, something curious happened: the world’s greatest proponents of stakeholder capitalism responded with the surprising claim that actually stakeholder capitalism is indeed the same thing as plain old capitalism.
 Despite this, the area changed drastically from the home of two future Presidents in 1950 to a crack-riddled area in 1990 and is now a mostly-Latino working class community.	That didn’t keep it from changing from the home of two future Presidents around 1950 to a crack hell around 1990 to a pretty nondescript mostly Latino working class community today.
 Lawyers who work with illegal immigrants will now be able to try to stop their fellow illegal immigrants from being sent back to their home countries.	These illegal-alien lawyers will now be allowed to try to prevent their fellow illegal aliens from being deported.
 Railroad workers have reminded us that the job situation in the United States is too important to be ignored.	Railroad workers have reminded us that the issue of work in the US is too explosive to ignore.
 No one knows the answer.	Nobody can answer that.
 We cannot keep going this way without serious results, either very bad or very revolutionary.	Obviously, we cannot continue in this direction without consequences either disastrous in fact or revolutionary in principle.
 They have not only accepted but actively supported the increasing cost of government.	They have not only tolerated but given encouragement to an ever-expanding cost of government.
 The fact mentioned emphasizes the biggest issue with these movements.	That fact alone underscores the biggest problem of all with these movements.
 Will monkeypox lead to another lockdown?	Is monkeypox going to be the “cause” of another lockdown?
 Therefore, there is a strong desire to borrow money from the public.	Hence the passion for public borrowing.
 It is wrong to create a segregated neighborhood based on race, so the highway should have been built in a different location, which would have prevented the segregated neighborhood and avoided creating more racism.	It is also racist to have a black neighborhood, so I 94 should have been routed elsewhere, cutting the black neighborhood from something or other, causing more racist mayhem.
 Now, you will witness a conflict of different interests inside the government.	And now you will see a selective struggle taking place within government itself.
 Don't let an opportunity to take advantage of a crisis pass you by, right?	Never let a good crisis go to waste, right?
"
It is becoming more and more common for us to use public credit to create a lower class of people who are poor and without much money. This class of people is known as those in the ""lower income ranges"" and even though they may not be poor, they still rely on public credit for their security, housing, health care, economic insurance, entertainment, and education. There is also a social service class that looks after the poor and keeps an eye on the dependent."	Increasingly, as it may seem, irresistibly, we are using public credit to create an indigent caste, indigence becoming more and more comfortable until for many it may seem a goal; then a very great dependent caste referred to as people in the “lower income ranges,” who, without being indigent at all, are yet dependent upon public credit for security, for modern housing, for care in illness, protection in health, economic insurance, amusement and guidance; then a social-service caste to mind the indigent and oversee the dependent.
 Recently, there have been surprising changes in the way companies like Amazon, Starbucks, and Chipotle are being managed.	More recently, unexpected organising has taken place at high-profile companies like Amazon, Starbucks, and Chipotle.
 The institution has tried to make it more home-like by providing motion-picture shows, concerts, an extensive library, pool tables, newspapers, and magazines. It's much more pleasant to live there than in many of the private homes that taxpayers have to pay for.	Every resource to soften its institutional features has been used, including motion-picture shows, concerts, an extensive library, pool tables, newspapers, magazines.” It is really a better place to live than many of the private homes taxed to support it.
 The Left political party wants to reduce the importance of being a United States citizen, and to give undocumented immigrants the same rights and privileges as legal citizens, and they are succeeding in doing this.	The Left wants to devalue and abolish citizenship and what it means to be American, and confer all the benefits of being legal on people who are illegal – and it is succeeding.
 It is not sensible to only focus or put all of our hope in one group of the working class, however, we cannot ignore how much potential and power logistics workers have.	While it’s misguided to put all focus or hope onto one section of the working class, we can’t ignore this immense latent power that logistics workers possess.
 There is not much money available to support the least fortunate areas, no plan to invest in fixing old infrastructure, and nothing that would help create new businesses across the country.	There is very little in the way of investment or powers for the most deprived regions, no plan for investment in creaking infrastructure, nothing that would support new industries across the country.
 The political leaders and media outlets were right to be concerned; if there had been a rail strike, it would have caused major disruption to our supply chain and the economy as a whole.	This panicked response from political elites and media institutions was not completely unfounded; a rail strike would indeed have caused a crisis in our supply chain and the general economy.
 After these passionate people come back from their national meetings, they make sure that their city spends more on services if they find it is not up to the standard they want.	Then these enthusiasts return home from their national gatherings, and if they find that their city spends less for such service, they make it their business to see that it soon attains such a standard.
 This sentence is trying to demonstrate how different forces with different motivations, such as economic, social and political, are merging and leading to the majority of the national income being taken over by the government. Some people have this intention while others do not.	Here is the intent only to show how unlike and differently motivated forces, economic, social and political, are tending together not only to swallow up the national income in government but also to produce a result which some intend and some do not.
 If these things are true and if in any crisis the responsibility of the government is given, then we have moved towards a state that we do not know much about from experience or theory.	But if these things are true, and if now in any crisis such responsibilities must pass to the government, we have gone far unawares toward an experimental state we know nothing of by experience, almost nothing of by theory.
 There is probably a perfect balance between two things, but I have never heard anyone talk about where it is.	Somewhere in-between is an optimum point, although I’ve never seen any discussion of where that would fall.
 When people have sold too many goods and investments, it is the government's job to stop this situation by providing credit in whatever way they deem necessary.	That when liquidation of commodities and securities has gone too far it becomes the business of government to stop it, using public credit by such means as it may think fit.
 On August 19, the Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico, which is all Democrat, made a unanimous decision on a new set of rules for admitting people to the bar. This decision was self-contradictory, but it was clearer than most reports written by left-wing writers.	The unanimous decision by the all-Democrat Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico, which came August 19 in the form of a new set of rules governing admission to the bar (pdf), is self-contradictory but it is clearer than most reports by leftist scribes.
 Are the leaders getting us ready to go into another lockdown due to a mutated monkeypox virus?	Are the rulers preparing us to accept another lockdown over a mutated monkeypox virus?
 Leftists often use kinder-sounding words to make it seem like the social issues they have caused have been solved.	Leftists are also fond of invoking the magic of euphemism to make the social problems they create go away.
 The least discussed aspect is the biological aspect, which is similar to an organism that instinctively needs to grow and express itself. If left to its own devices, it will inevitably take away human freedom, not because it purposefully wants to do this, but because it is in its nature to do so.	The one least considered is what may be called the biological aspect, in which government is like an organism with such an instinct for growth and self-expression that if let alone it is bound to destroy human freedom—not that it might wish to do so but that it could not in nature do less.
 Putin said that he was too busy to attend the event, but he was still offended that he was not invited to attend or have a representative go in his place. Only two other heads of state, Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus and Lt General Myint Swe of Myanmar, were not invited as well.	Although Putin claimed that he would have been too busy to attend anyway, that he was one of the few heads of state – along with Belarus's Alexander Lukashenko and Myanmar's Lt General Myint Swe – not invited either to attend or send a representative did hit a nerve.
 What happens next?	What then?
 Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock and one of the most influential people promoting stakeholder capitalism, believes that companies need to be constantly proving their worth to society in order to keep operating, and this is an admirable opinion.	This is what the world’s most influential proponent of stakeholder capitalism, BlackRock’s chief executive Larry Fink, meant when he proclaimed that “companies need to earn their social license to operate every day.” This is a respectable view.
 This is another instance of someone trying to take control or authority.	It is another power grab.
 In addition, these forces are not considering the consequences of their actions.	Moreover, these forces are thoughtless.
 We have not even thought about what type of situation that would be, let alone decide if we want it.	We have not considered what kind of state that would be, much less to decide if we want it.
 We used extraordinary measures to win the war, and we can use those same measures to combat the depression.	We used such emergency powers to win the war; we can use them to fight the depression.
" This small amount of money was followed by twelve different ""missions"" - some of which were aimed at reducing the number of homicides, and others which had more vague goals like increasing people's pride in the area."	This paltry fund was followed up with twelve further ‘missions’—some containing specific aims to reduce rates of homicide, others more nebulous like increasing ‘pride in place’.
" The Left uses the word ""immigrant"" to refer to anyone affected by the country's immigration laws, regardless of whether they are in the country illegally or legally."	This is also why the Left describes just about everyone touched by the nation’s immigration laws as an “immigrant” – whether they’re illegal aliens or legal permanent residents.
" Even though the words ""levelling down"" were removed, this etymology sheds light on the Conservative Party's main concern: not allowing them to share their wealth with the public which is necessary to make investments around the United Kingdom."	They may have dropped the ‘levelling down’ part of the phrase, but this etymology shows the real pre-occupation of the Tory Party: preventing the redistribution of their wealth ‘down’ to the public, the very redistribution required to invest across the UK.
" In April 2021, the Biden-Harris administration asked U.S. immigration enforcement agencies to stop using the terms ""alien"" and ""illegal alien."""	The Thought Police in the Biden-Harris regime ordered U.S. immigration enforcement agencies in April 2021 to refrain from using “alien” and “illegal alien.”
 The newspaper Izvestia, which had been very negative about Liz Truss, gave their readers a detailed explanation of how well planned the event was and that it went off without any problems.	Newspaper Izvestia, which has been brutal towards Liz Truss, treated its readers to a detailed account that recognised the meticulous planning behind the event and noted that it passed off without a hitch.
 That state has 62 counties, 60 cities, 932 towns, 507 villages, and 9,600 school districts. It is difficult to provide efficient service since there are roughly 11,000 independent administrative officers or boards who may have competing identities and jealousies.	That state has sixty-two counties and sixty cities … In addition there are 932 towns, 507 villages, and, at the last count, 9,600 school districts … Just try to render efficient service … amid the diffused identities and inevitable jealousies of, roughly, 11,000 independent administrative officers or boards!

 If someone remembers a Southern senator angrily announcing that he would take a pig for his people every time a Northerner got a ham, they may feel offended, but it is not directed towards them personally.	One who remembers a Southern senator shouting out loud that he would steal for his people a hog every time a Yankee got a ham may be indignant, but the feeling is not personal.
" Shock jocks like Skabeyeva have a role of bringing Jerry Springer's aggressive energy to the ""Two Minutes Hate"" from George Orwell's novel."	As for 'shock jocks' like Skabeyeva, their role is to bring the combative energy of Jerry Springer to George Orwell's ‘Two Minutes Hate.’
 For many years, the government has been attempting to control the planning system in order to limit any opposition to new housing projects or fracking rigs.	As I have written previously, the government has been trying for years to centralise the planning system to remove as much space for dissent to developments, whether that be newbuild housing estates or shale gas fracking rigs.
 Imagine that they worked hard and the luck was on their side, and we can find a way to regain stability.	Suppose they did work, the tide rising to save and redeem them, and that we should be able to perform the terrific gymnastic feat of getting back our equilibrium.
 Often, when politicians use vague and buzzword-filled language, it is because they are trying to hide more than they are willing to express.	Usually, when politicians use these open, Newspeak-type terms, it is because they are trying to obscure more than they want to say.
 It could be argued that the most damaging problem we are facing today is the escalating cultural divisions within democracies that seem to have no solution.	It’s arguably the most damaging of them all: rampant and increasingly irresolvable cultural discord in democracies around the world.
 The government should be responsible for providing security for people in their old age, protecting children, helping widows, providing insurance for employment, better maternity care, public nursing, recreation for adults, plumbing, housing, taking care of infants, providing vocational guidance, helping people use their leisure time, and providing everything that people need for a good life.	Thus, government responsibility for old-age security, child life, tonsils, widows, backward mentalities, employment insurance, better maternity, public nursing, recreation, adult play, plumbing, housing, right nurture, infant feeding, vocational guidance, the use of leisure, everything of the good life for everybody, as a responsibility of the state, to procure it, provide it, superintend it.
 It has been a difficult journey to get to this point.	It has been a bumpy road even to this juncture.
 Some scams are so incredibly outrageous that Americans refuse to participate in them.	There are some frauds so massively insane that Americans won’t do them.
 At first, we often think of the traditional images associated with certain people: machines, bosses, pork barrels, spoils systems, politicians who appear popular by using public money to benefit their people as well as gain power and recognition for themselves.	First by habit one thinks of those for which we have traditional images: The machine, the boss, the pork barrel, the spoils system, the politician everywhere in his popular character, acquiring merit and power by spending public money; doing things for his people with the money of other people, taking care at the same time to do enough for himself with everybody’s money.
 We think today that things are done without any individual in the group wanting to take action.	We imagine today that everything is done by the aggregate without the will to act of any of the individuals composing the aggregate.
 In modern times, Russia uses propaganda as a way of controlling the population, although it is not as extreme as it was during the Soviet period.	Modern Russia is a propaganda state, but not in the same way as the Soviet Union.
 In this economy where the wealthy become wealthier, the poor have no chance to get ahead.	In this zombie neoliberalism, there is only levelling up for the already rich.
 The struggle to get our economy running again during this emergency changes often and needs new strategies.	The battle to set our economic machine in motion in this emergency takes new forms and requires new tactics from time to time.
 They both have a similar response when they see people suffering: poverty, hardship, or any kind of misery they think can be relieved.	What they have in common is a certain reaction to the sight of human misery, squalor, discomfort, disadvantage or what they believe to be curable wretchedness.
 However, the political talk shows on television at night, whose hosts seem to compete to see who can be the most extreme and prejudiced, had a different approach.	Yet the evening TV political talk shows, whose hosts seem to compete to be more strident and xenophobic than the next, took a very different tack.
 People living in Western democracies like America and Britain now feel that something is wrong.	The everyday citizen in Western democracies ranging from America to Britain now correctly senses that something is amiss.
 Most of us do not deserve this kind of kindness, it often arrives too late and with some bitterness.	Yet this unction is by most of us undeserved; it comes after the fact, with some sourness in it.
" It is clear that the government is trying to fit their unpopular planning reforms into the Levelling Up legislation, which shows how empty the government's ""defining mission"" really is."	That the government are shoehorning what is left of their unpopular planning reforms into this Levelling Up legislation speaks to the vacuity of the ‘defining mission’.
 Initially, the Bill does not provide much action or investment that would noticeably improve the lives of people from all over the UK—especially those who have not had the same investment as London and the South East have had in the past few decades.	In its initial draft, though, the Bill contains very little that can be said to ‘Level Up’, in the sense of action and investment that would significantly alter the lives of people across the UK—those whose towns, cities, and infrastructure have lacked the investment of London and parts of the South East for decades.
 This is good for us because it reveals all of the problems in our system and who is really in control.	This is actually a win for us because it exposes all the faults within our system and the reality of the people who are in power.
 It could help governments by increasing their spending or helping to make up for financial losses that have been experienced.	It could increase spending or help bridge the financial gaps suffered by lower levels of government.
 Anyone who is bravely predicting what the world will look like in one to three years is only guessing.	Anyone sticking their head above the parapet and claiming they know where the world will be in 12-36 months is sticking their finger in the air.
 I think that we won't find a solution for the current vaccine and we will hear about a new, more dangerous variant that the vaccine won't be able to protect us from.	My speculation is that it won’t and instead, we’ll be told there’s a new and deadly terrible vaccine-resistant variant that even five shots won’t stop.
 Despite the Tory party's willingness to spend a lot of public money, especially in potentially corrupt ways, during the pandemic, they still disagree with the idea of the state investing in targeted and long-term projects.	The Tories may have been happy to spend lots of public money during the pandemic, some of it in ways the borders on the corrupt, but they still oppose the idea that the state can and should make targeted, long-term investments.
 Don't forget that the pandemic is still ongoing.	And remember that the pandemic isn’t over.
 Society gave shareholders of corporations a special privilege that normal people do not have: they are not personally responsible for the debts of the corporation.	Society endowed shareholders of corporations an extraordinary gift that ordinary persons do not enjoy: limited liability.
 Now, the forces that act upon a certain political ideology are much more powerful.	Now, much more potent are the forces acting upon a definite political doctrine.
 As this logistics system becomes more connected and delicate, the power of these workers increases significantly.	As this logistics system becomes more interdependent and fragile, the potential leverage of these workers increases to a dramatic level.
 What is the size of the problem?	Here's everything you need to know:  How big is the problem?
 The Chief Justice of the state, Democrat C. Shannon Bacon, and the other justices seem to be determined to allow illegal immigrants to become lawyers. If an illegal immigrant is involved in illegal or unethical conduct such as stealing a Social Security number or pretending to be someone else in order to avoid being caught by the authorities, this will not stop them from being accepted into the legal profession.	Presumably, since the woke state chief justice, Democrat C. Shannon Bacon, and her fellow justices are hellbent on letting illegal aliens practice law, illegal or unethical conduct flowing out of an illegal alien’s everyday acts aimed at escaping detection by authorities or at falsely appearing to be a legal alien, such as stealing Social Security numbers or other documents or impersonating other people, won’t prevent him or her from being admitted to the bar.
 Many journalists are trying to hold on to the remaining parts of their professional standards.	Many journalists are trying to cling to the remnants of their professional standards.
 The results of social services and the work we do for those in need is commendable and makes us feel good; we are helping those less fortunate.	The effects and works of social service are very flattering to our sense of benignity; we are doing well by the less fortunate.
 If we have now accepted that during times of depression the government must take on more responsibilities that we are willing to give it, then the government will continue to grow without interruption and the only problem remaining is how people can protect themselves from it.	If now it is established that in time of depression government must extend itself even faster, prodigiously, in order to meet the responsibilities which we are so willing to pass to it by default, then the growth of government will be uninterruptible, without time or season, and the last problem of all is how people shall defend themselves against it.
 It is obvious that when the amount of money the government spends suddenly increases from its usual amount to one-quarter of the total national income in one generation, it is a very significant sign of political and social change.	Whatever else may go by conjecture, this will be evident in itself—namely, that a rise in the cost of government, suddenly in one generation, from a traditional basis to a point at which it begins to absorb one-quarter of the total national income, is a political and social omen of great significance.
 Precision schedule railroading has drastically lowered the workforce, but has provided immense benefits to investors on Wall Street.	The adoption of precision schedule railroading has dramatically reduced the number of workers, while delivering immense gains to Wall Street.
 It is necessary for the government to be able to recognize when a crisis is occurring, decide when liquidation has been taken too far, determine when prices are too low or too high, understand how many bank and railroad failures are enough to trigger a crisis in their respective fields, and so on.	And it follows by necessity that certain functions of government are assumed, as, for example, the wisdom to know when a crisis is such a crisis, to know when liquidation has gone far enough, when prices are too low, when they are high enough again, how many bank failures constitute a crisis in banking, how many railroad failures constitute a crisis in railroad credit, and so on.
 It is not effective because it only tries to reduce a very severe financial strain on taxpayers. If anyone thinks that cutting the cost of government through savings and increased efficiency will reduce the size of the government, they are missing the essential point.	It is superficial wherein it aims only to abate a very acute pain in the taxpayer’s pocket, and if anyone supposes that reducing the cost of government by economy and greater efficiency will limit government itself, it is elusive at the crucial point.
 When banking fails due to bad banking, wild speculation, or credit inflation, it is the government's job to provide public credit to support the banking system, not to save the banks, but to protect the people who have deposited their money.	That when from bad banking, wild speculation, senseless credit inflation, or no matter from what cause, the private banking structure seems about to fall, it becomes a function of government to support it with public credit, not particularly to save the banks, but to save depositors.
 What relief does the taxpayer think they will get?	What relief does the taxpayer imagine?
 The senator was only a regular person.	The senator was only human.
 Corporate law was created to limit the power of corporations by focusing their boards on the financial interests of their shareholders. This was to protect democracy and other civic institutions from being overly influenced by corporations. As a result, non-profit corporations are given certain legal advantages if they keep their activities focused on charitable causes.	By limiting the focus of corporate boards to shareholders’ financial interests alone, corporate law intended to confine the sphere of influence of corporations as a means of protecting democracy and other civic institutions from corporate overreach—just as society confers certain legal advantages to non-profit corporations in return for confining their activities to the sphere of charitable causes.
 From the perspective of the government, which is trying to make money, this kind of competition is embarrassing and not based on science.	Such competition is embarrassing and unscientific from the common point of view of government seeking revenue.
 China is doing an especially good job of fighting against the coronavirus (COVID-19).	But no one fights covid-19 like China.
 This is just the income tax!	This is the income tax alone!
 Many people are currently criticizing the UK, but the things that make Britain a secure place to live and work have not changed: it is located on the Greenwich meridian, allowing for trading with the East and West; it has a stable government; it is an island; and it has a reliable system of laws.	Plenty of people are keen to diss the UK at the moment, but the factors that make Britain a safe place to live and work remain steady – we are on the Greenwich meridian so can trade east and west; we are politically stable; we are an island; and we have a strong rule of law.
 Even though people talk about moving to a service and post-industrial economy, it's not possible to ignore the fact that our economy still needs industrial workers to function.	Despite all the talk of a postindustrial and service economy, there is no getting around the fact that our economy still cannot function without industrial labour.
 In the past, our system of capitalism that was focused on maximizing profits provided a place of safety and refuge, but not anymore.	Our system of unbridled profit-focused capitalism used to serve as perhaps the most important of those sanctuaries, but no longer.
 Are they purposefully seeking someone to blame for the drug-resistant form of the monkeypox?	Or, are they actively trying to make sure they have a scapegoat for a drug-resistant form of the monkeypox?
 Despite this, it was seen as an exaggerated comparison when African leaders had to travel by bus and Joe Biden, a white man, had his own car.	Even so, the 'racist scandal' proved to be a rather contrived comparison to the way African heads of state were forced to travel by bus, while a ‘white gentleman’, Joe Biden, could take his own car.
 These ideas quickly spread from one area to another.	And so these ideas spread like wildfire from community to community.
 A group of people, made up of practical reformers, idealists, and good-government people, with or without any political theory, was formed to extend the government's control and absorb the national income.	A third formation of forces moving in a parallel manner to absorb the national income by extension of government is made up of practical reformers, idealists, good-government people, with or without any political theory.
 If taxes have to be raised significantly, it is good as long as the taxes are for the general public. This way, the wealth is shared more fairly and capitalist society will eventually face difficulty.	If taxation meanwhile has to be heavily increased, so much the better, so long as the increase is, as it certainly will be, in the field of popular taxes, for thereby wealth is redistributed downward and capitalist society, in which they disbelieve, is on its way to trouble.
 If you want to understand the global economy, you should pay attention to what is happening with luxury properties in London.	If you’re looking for a bellwether for the world economy, you could do worse than consider what’s happening at the very highest end of London’s property market.
 The first thought people might have is that the war caused the strain on resources, due to the costs of the war such as veterans' relief, pensions and national defense.	The first thought will be that the war did it—the war itself and the after costs of the war in such things as veterans’ relief, pensions and national defense.
 A difference has occurred between what was expected for China's gross domestic product at the beginning of this year and the less optimistic prediction now likely to happen.	A gap has opened up between the gdp path envisaged for China at the start of this year and the grimmer one that now seems probable.
 The public revenue is still lacking because the sudden and severe reduction in what is taxable caused an unexpected decrease.	There is yet everywhere a deficit in the public revenue because the shrinkage in everything taxable was so sudden and violent.
" Leftists argue that the phrase ""illegal alien"" is wrong and makes people feel less human."	Leftists claim the perfectly good legal phrase “illegal alien” is somehow sinister and dehumanizing.
 Illegal immigrants are guilty of breaking the law and it is unlikely that they will go through their daily routines without doing something dishonest, fraudulent, or deceptive.	Of course, illegal aliens by definition are guilty of unlawful conduct and it is hard to imagine them going about their daily business without committing acts involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.
 The Levelling Up Bill is actually a Planning Bill, which was made clear by the Committee during the start of their evidence sessions.	What the Levelling Up Bill is really is a Planning Bill in disguise, something the Committee made clear at the very beginning of their evidence sessions.
 It might mean giving them away, but the first chance they get, they will take them all back.	It may mean to surrender them, but on the first new occasion it will take them all back.
 It is obvious that the first COVID vaccinations did not prevent people from getting COVID, so why would this new one be any different?	But it’s more than clear that the original COVID shots aren’t stopping COVID, so why would this one work?
 And do you know what?	And guess what?
 The new booster shots the doctors want everyone to get are coming just in time for Halloween.	It’s also just in time for the new booster shots that they want everyone to get before Halloween.
 We need to raise taxes to make the same amount of public revenue as before, and then raise them again to make more money than before.	Therefore, taxes must be increased, first in order to provide as much public revenue as before, and then further increased to provide more revenue than before.
 The city of Chicago had made so many bad financial decisions such as taxation, borrowing and spending that it had been unable to pay its employees or borrow money from the bank for a long time.	From bad taxation, reckless borrowing and reckless spending, the city of Chicago had so far prejudiced its own credit that for months it had been unable to meet its municipal payrolls either out of revenues or by discounting its notes at the bank.
 Who is so mean that they won't pay taxes, and so concerned with their wealth that they won't support increasing taxes to help these disadvantaged children?	Who so mean that he will not himself be taxed, who so mindful of wealth that he will not favor increasing the popular taxes, in aid of these defective children?
 This leader now has the support of people who benefit from social services, those who provide and rely on them, and those who work to give and receive. He still has the same amount of power as before.	Such a boss as this now commands the support, first, of all the beneficiaries of social service; secondly, of all who promote and live by social service; thirdly, of those whose doctrine is to take and give; and he has still his machine as it was before.
 Most social services are not donations made directly by taxpayers out of the goodness of their hearts.	Very little social service is really spontaneous, straight from the taxpayer’s heart.
 It is one thing to measure the cost of government, but it is another to have a large amount of government regardless of the cost.	The cost of government by measure is one thing; the quantity of government, at any cost, is another.
 It looks like they are preparing for multiple different approaches.	It seems like there are gearing up for several different angles.
 People who are reasonable can disagree with this question, and this debate will take a lot of research and books to make a final decision.	Reasonable minds can differ on this question, and this debate will take further book-length works to fully adjudicate.
 Despite the fact that the number of cases is decreasing and the global population is close to 8 billion, the number of cases worldwide has not even reached 23,000 yet, but people are still panicking and spreading fear.	Even as cases slow, and worldwide cases (global population approaching 8 billion) have yet to top 23,000, the panic and fear-mongering continues.
 But we are dealing with the economic repercussions of too much spending and unwarranted fear of the future of the United States.	But we are fighting the economic consequences of overliquidation and unjustified fear as to the future of the United States.
 There is a freeway that passes through the south and east edges of Compton. In general, Compton appears to be well-connected because it is situated in the middle of a rectangular freeway system.	A freeway runs through the south edge of Compton and along its east edge, but, overall, it looks to me to be pretty well served by freeways, sitting in the middle of a rectangle of freeways.
 The Conservative Party's manifesto in 2019 was not very detailed in terms of what they wanted to do while in power, except for the main promise of 'Getting Brexit Done'.	The Conservative manifesto in 2019 was one of the least substantial in terms of what it proposed for a ruling party’s agenda, outside of its one major pledge to ‘Get Brexit Done’.
 We will have accomplished something else.	And we shall have done another thing.
 They don't want to spread money around; they just want to take advantage of it.	They do not want to redistribute wealth; they want only to prey upon it.
 Very few journalists wondered why many areas that had been neglected previously needed to be improved.	Few journalists thought to ask why it is large parts of ‘left behind’ places needed ‘levelling up’ in the first place.
 Other countries tried to do something that was impossible.	Other countries pushed on a string.
 They advocate that the government should be in charge of providing happiness, not because they wish for such a government, but because it is possible.	They preach a gospel of the responsibility of the state to administer happiness, not because the state should, not because they themselves would prefer the kind of state that does, but simply that the state can.
 If people started to lose trust in the government, it would be the least of the problems that would result.	The loss of public credit, the complete ruin of it, would be the least of the consequences.
 When the economy is doing well, governments will spend more money because there is more money available and people will often demand special benefits that can only be provided with public funding.	Observe that in time of prosperity government is bound to extend itself because revenues are plenty and there is always a purblind demand for special benefits to be conferred by public credit.
 A new form of the virus that is resistant to vaccines and causes more harm to people will emerge when the government wants to put people in lockdown again to make them comply out of fear.	A new variant that can evade vaccines and actually harm people will surface when the ruling class needs another lockdown to panic the unruly slaves into mass compliance out of fear.
 No one in a democratic society should want those in charge of financial institutions worth 10 trillion dollars to have more influence on what social values should be and how they should be put into action.	No citizen in a democratic society should want executives from $10trn financial institutions to play a larger role than they already do in defining and implementing social values.
 The news media repeated the slogan and sincerely asked what it might mean and when it might happen. They also added their own ideas about it.	News media repeated the slogan, inquired sincerely as to what it might mean, asked when it might happen, projected their own visions on to it.
 We may have finished with the chaotic pricing system which we believed was controlled by the law of supply and demand.	It may be that we are done with the anarchy of prices which we have so long justified by supposing a law of supply and demand.
 The Chicago City Council meeting minutes from May 12th is an example of how often we think about public trust.	In the minutes of the Chicago City Council, May 12th last is the perfect example of how commonly we regard public credit.
 We should not allow ministers to make decisions based on who is able to influence them at a fundraising dinner. Instead, we should give more responsibility to local, regional, and devolved national governments so that they can make decisions based on what the citizens need, especially when it comes to housing and utilities.	Instead of giving ministers more power to make decisions based on whomever has been able to lobby them successfully at the fundraising dinner, we need to be empowering local, regional, and devolved national governments to make decisions based on the needs of citizens, particularly in relation to housing and utilities.
 This sentence also shows why they can't be trusted to solve the problem of unequal rights in different areas.	It also reveals the limits of their ideological position, why they can never really be counted on to address regional inequality.
 This is the best argument in favor of stakeholder capitalism.	This is the strongest case for stakeholder capitalism.
 These extreme liberals, Socialists, and radicals are genuinely against corruption in government, and they believe that raising taxes is a way to reduce the wealth gap between the rich and the poor.	Such are the extreme liberals, the Socialists, the radicals, themselves perfectly honest, all haters of graft and corruption in government, yet who are for increasing popular taxes on any pretense of public benefit because that is one way of redistributing wealth downward, according to their doctrine.
 Furthermore, the constant fear of having certain businesses and activities closed down has caused both consumers and business owners to feel uncertain and doubtful.	In addition, the ever-present threat of lockdowns has crushed the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs.
 The stability of a democratic society with diverse ideas and beliefs relies on keeping certain places free from political views, especially when the people have different opinions about politics.	The social fabric of a diverse democracy depends on preserving certain spaces as apolitical sanctuaries, especially in a divided body politic like ours.
 We cannot talk about it until we know where we are headed.	There cannot even be a discussion of it until we see clearly where we are going.
 Is this a form of providing information in advance to influence current events?	Is this predictive programming?
 When lots of people have the ability to tax, it is less effective than it could be.	The tax power, in so many hands, is much less effective than it might be.
 It is difficult to borrow money from creditors, but what if we hadn't been able to borrow money from them?	Creditors are hard, yes; only, suppose there had been no creditors to borrow from.
 This pain is hindering the government's growth, causing it to be a source of fear.	This pain is the terror of government because it arrests its growth.
 Taxes have become so high that they are consuming people's possessions and the taxpayer is desperate for relief.	Taxes have risen to a point at which they begin to devour people’s possessions, and the taxpayer is wild for relief.
 Conservatism is about helping people to achieve more and move up in life.	Conservatism is about levelling up.
 The taxpayer doesn't have the right to feel superior while they are receiving social services.	There is another reason why the taxpayer himself is not entitled to that unctuous feeling in the presence of social service.
 The people who support stakeholder capitalism (where managers make decisions that benefit stakeholders instead of just shareholders) gather in ski towns to criticize the increasing popularity of populism, but they do not understand that populism is an expected result of their own beliefs.	The apostles of stakeholder capitalism convene in ski towns to decry the rise of populism without recognising that populism is itself an inevitable byproduct of their creed.
 In this world, information about properties is not shared on websites that are not official; instead, it is managed and kept secret by a group of high-end real estate agents that do not share any information with the public.	This is not a world where details of properties circulate on supposed ‘off market’ websites; it’s one controlled by a cabal of high-end buying/selling agents operating completely off the grid.
 Because of this, the government is using and planning to use its financial resources in a way that has never been done before to deal with a situation that will soon be over.	Therefore these unprecedented uses of the public credit now being made, and proposed to be made, are to meet a crisis that must soon pass.
 They are probably correct.	They’re probably right.
 When corporate leaders use their influence and power in the market to make decisions about politics, his opinion has less value.	His voice counts for less when corporate elites use market power to settle political questions.
" Due to the significant decrease in property values and the government's ""zero-covid"" policy, which includes lockdowns any time the virus is detected, major banks like Nomura, Morgan Stanley, and UBS now predict that the economy will grow by less than 3% in 2022."	Thanks to its deep property slump and the government’s “zero-covid” policy, which entails lockdowns in response to every outbreak of the virus, the economy is now forecast to grow by less than 3% in 2022, according to banks such as Nomura, Morgan Stanley and ubs.
 These ideas of refuge and solution in public credit are not only plausible, they are usually well-intentioned and hopeful.	Not only are all these ideas of refuge and solution in public credit to some degree plausible; very often they are of good and wistful intention.
 The central government could do more to help boost economic growth.	In principle, the central government could do more itself to revive growth.
 We predicted that after the Food and Drug Administration decided to approve an experimental vaccine booster without any human trials specifically for Omicron, new variants would come.	As we predicted, new variants will come after the Food and Drug Administration decided to approve an experimental vaccine booster with no human trials specifically for Omicron.
 Although left-wingers often accuse conservatives of speaking in a way that hides their real meaning, former Congressman Charles Rangel from New York even said that tax cuts were used as a disguised way to express racism. However, despite this accusation, it is actually left-wingers who speak in code.	Although left-wingers are fond of saying conservatives speak in code –former Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) famously said tax cuts were racist dog whistles (“It’s not ‘spic’ or ‘n*****’ anymore. They say, ‘Let’s cut taxes”)– leftists really do speak in code.
 What this means is that the government will be extended, not just bad government but both good and bad.	What it means is extension of government—not bad government only but good and bad together.
 The bus company in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, had an inventive idea to help pay the past due salaries of some of their employees.	An indebted state-owned bus company in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, floated an ingenious idea to pay the overdue salaries of some of its staff.
 The people who spent money were the ones who were voted into office and the public voted for bond issues with enthusiasm.	The spenders were the ones elected to office and bond issues voted with cheerful alacrity.
 In other words, a corrupt government tends to restrict and weaken itself.	That is to say, corrupt government tends to limit and defeat itself.
 I hope that Congress will recognize how important it is to pass this legislation to protect elderly people, especially since they have already provided $2 billion to protect the banking interests of the United States.	It is my hope that the Congress, which has seen fit to provide $2 billion to protect the banking interests of the United States, will see the necessity of passing this legislation to protect the old people.
 When looking at the bigger picture, this labour dispute shows that more and more US workers are feeling restless and are ready to fight.	Zooming out to a broader view, this labour dispute is one more sign of a growing restlessness and combativity among US workers.
 We need the same amount of government but we need to spend less money.	Not less government, you see; the same amount of government for less money.
 These forces that prey on others, gain benefits from others, and lack shame are closely connected with the government.	These predatory, parasitic, more or less shameless forces are inseparable from government.
 When the railroads ask the government for financial assistance to avoid going bankrupt, these radical forces do not strongly oppose it, or if they do, they are more theoretical arguments; this is because they favor public ownership of the railroads and they understand that getting public money may make that happen.	When the railroads throw themselves on the hands of the government and demand public credit to save them from bankruptcy, these radical forces do not protest, or, if they do, it is in an academic sense only; and the reason for this is that they believe in the public ownership of railroads, and see, perhaps more clearly than the others, that such use of public credit tends to bring the experiment of state ownership to pass.
 Local governments and the organizations they used to provide funding for the stimulus efforts in 2008 are not as confident now.	Local governments and their financing vehicles, which led the stimulus efforts in 2008, are not now so bold.
 We should all work for the government in some way, either by being state employees or by supporting those who work for the government.	Then we should all be working for government, either directly as state employees or indirectly to support the employees of the state.
" Boris Johnson said that ""levelling up"" was the most important thing his government was working on, but really the only reason they used this phrase was to make it look like they were doing something good while they were actually introducing harsh laws and weakening democracy."	Boris Johnson declared ‘levelling up’ the ‘defining mission’ of his administration, but in practice the main usage of this slogan-policy was to pretend the government was actually doing something positive alongside its various draconian pieces of legislation and attacks on democracy.
 Repeating that anyone who believes in laws is anti-immigrant will make people feel attacked and cause them to disagree less.	Smearing anyone who believes in the rule of law as anti-immigrant over and over again makes people defensive and wears down the opposition.
 Modern cities are a completely new type of existence, and we don't have a way to study them yet; in this new environment, an individual's powerlessness is becoming a bigger and bigger problem for society.	The modern city is a new form of life, really, and one that we have no science for; in that form individual helplessness is a rising social liability.
 Aleksandar Vučić, who had previously been a radical on the far-right, became the Prime Minister in that year after changing his politics to be more moderate and gaining the approval of important people in the European Union.	Vučić, a former far-right radical, became prime minister that year after moderating his politics and winning the support of EU bigwigs.
" Despite this, I argue in my book ""Woke, Inc"", which was published last year, that it is lacking for legal and historical reasons."	Nonetheless I believe it falls short for legal and historical reasons that I lay out in “Woke, Inc”, my book published last year.
 We need the same amount of government we had before, but with less money spent.	Not less government; only as much government as before for less money.
 The Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill shows that the ruling party only wants to make the wealthy richer and does not care about helping people in need.	The content of the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill proves that the only levelling up the ruling party is interested in is levelling up the bank accounts of the already rich.
 These days, anything can happen.	Anything is possible in these times we live in.
 If the government really cares about making sure everyone has equal opportunities and helping people who are struggling to get ahead, they would be doing the opposite of what this Bill requires.	A government serious about equality and ‘levelling up’ would be looking to do the opposite of what this Bill does.
 It should be obvious to most people why there hasn't been any true improvement in living standards: it goes against what the Conservative Party believes in and what is best for them.	The reason for the lack of any actual ‘levelling up’ should be quite clear to most people: it runs against the ideology and interests of the Conservative Party.
 Even the economics writers from The Times have agreed that the Tories don't have any ideas to help economic growth. Instead, they are trying to expand the ways in which wealthy people can be protected, build things in communities who don't want them, and allow Tory donors to create low quality, environmentally-unfriendly private homes, which will have to be replaced within a few decades, if they don't fall apart sooner.	With even the economics writers at the Times conceding that the Tories have absolutely no plan for economic growth, what we instead have are attempts to extend the means by which rentier capitalism can be protected, extraction sites can be built against the wishes of the community, and Tory donors can continue to produce poor quality, un-ecological private homes that will need to be torn down in a couple of decades, if they don’t collapse before then.
 Previously, the way the news was reported about the Queen's death was very respectful, following the message of condolences from Vladimir Putin.	As I have written before, the official line on the Queen's death was strikingly respectful, taking its lead from Vladimir Putin's own message of condolences.
 The cost of government should be reduced.	This—that the cost of government shall be reduced.
 If the economy did not recover quickly, then these measures would fail and cause public credit to collapse.	If the natural level of economic recovery were long delayed, then all these measures would very soon fail in the total ruin of public credit.
 Just like after the war, there is sure to be a big increase in government involvement.	And there is bound to be, again as it was after the war, a terrific extension of government.
 Unless we figure out what public credit should be used for in a fundamental way and significantly reduce how much the government grows, then it won't be like pruning a tree that will lead to stronger development in the future.	But that will be only like pruning the tree, for lustier growth hereafter, unless we settle what public credit is for in principle and limit in a drastic manner the ferocious growth of government.
 Stakeholder capitalism is part of a belief system that says business leaders should be involved in deciding and carrying out the main values of a community.	Stakeholder capitalism is part of a broader worldview that holds that corporate leaders should play a fundamental role in determining and implementing a society’s core values.
 Republicans tried to pass a law that would make it possible for Congress to make workers accept an agreement, but Senator Bernie Sanders was able to stop it.	Republicans attempted to pass a resolution that would have enabled Congress to force workers to accept a deal, which was fortunately blocked by (who else) Senator Bernie Sanders.
" People joked that it was fitting when Biden's huge armored limousine, known as ""The Beast,"" got stuck in traffic."	That the infamous 'Beast,' Biden's eight ton armoured presidential limousine, got stuck in traffic was gloatingly treated as poetic justice.
" It is hard to read the reports that policy wonks write because they don't make it clear whether they are talking about immigrants who are legally present or if they are using the word ""immigrants"" as a way of referring to people who are in the country illegally."	This makes reading the reports indoctrinated policy wonks write difficult to read because when they write about “immigrants” it is unclear if they actually mean lawfully present immigrants or if they are using the word as a euphemism for illegal aliens.
" The newspapers often criticized either the British government for ""playing politics"" (treating the state funeral as if it were a meeting for negotiations) or for how it handled the Saudi and Chinese delegations, or the Americans."	Indeed, what criticisms the newspapers aired were generally aimed either at the British government, for ‘playing politics’ (as if any state funeral is not an impromptu summit) or clumsily handling the Saudi and Chinese delegations or the Americans.
