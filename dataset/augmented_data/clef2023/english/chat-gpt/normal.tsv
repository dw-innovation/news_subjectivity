The Skabeyevas do well in a environment that promotes distrust and fear of foreigners.	The Skabeyevas thrive in an atmosphere of conspiracy and xenophobia.
In China, the government encouraged state-owned businesses and local-government funding programs to borrow heavily from Chinese banks to invest in infrastructure and other community projects.	In China, by contrast, state-owned enterprises and local-government financing vehicles (which invest in infrastructure and other civic projects) borrowed eagerly from China’s banks at the government’s behest.
However, the White House and mainstream media will attempt to steer clear of having that type of discussion.	But the White House and mainstream media will try to avoid that kind of conversation.
A lot of excellent work was done, but the people couldn't afford to pay for it.	A great deal of that admirable work was not paid for; the people could not afford to pay for it.
In the American Experiment, Glahn discovered that there are 312 places authorized for the Feeding Our Future program. These sites have been approved to serve a maximum of 126,000 children. This means that there are many Somali children who are in need of food.	Glahn in American Experiment found that, “Feeding Our Future had 312 authorized sites for the program, approved for a maximum of 126,000 children.” That’s a lot of hungry Somali kids.
When will the next variant come that can't be stopped by this vaccine?	So, when is the next variant that will evade this vaccine too?
The people as a whole own public credit and can use it however they want.	Public credit belongs to the people as a whole and they may do anything with it they like.
People tend to act in contradictory ways because they don't have enough personal drive, which is caused by their fear of taking responsibility.	The basis of this paradoxical inclination is the lack of personal will, and this lack of personal will itself comes from the horror of responsibility
The effectiveness of a vaccine itself cannot be measured by its vaccine effectiveness.	Vaccine effectiveness is NOT a measure of the effectiveness of a vaccine.
If we organize the government system better, we can have the same amount of government services for less cost.	Certainly if the structure of government were rationalized, we could easily have as much government as before for less money.
So during tough times like these, the government will take a larger share of the total national income.	Thus, in bad times like these, the proportion of the total national income absorbed by government will rise in a special manner.
It's a way of manipulating someone's thoughts and beliefs through repeated messages or conditioning.	It’s a kind of brainwashing.
No, of course not.	Of course not.
The Bill does not address this issue. Instead, we are expected to trust whichever wealthy landlord or former oil executive is appointed as a minister.	There is nothing in this Bill that does this; instead, we are being invited to put out trust whichever multi-millionaire landlord or former oil executive gets given the ministerial position.
It is easy to understand.	The explanation is simple.
However, a large number of the 3.1 million teachers who work in public schools across the country have lost their enthusiasm for the job.	Still, many of the nation's 3.1 million public-school teachers have become deeply disenchanted with the profession.
Because they received a special gift, the people who own the corporation have a duty to give back to society. This means that when making choices, the corporation shouldn't only think about what will benefit the shareholders, but should also think about what will be good for society as a whole.	In return for this extraordinary gift, corporate shareholders owed an implicit obligation back to society: namely, that corporations ought to consider not only shareholder interests but broader societal interests when making decisions.
Even if this initial agreement is accepted or rejected, there will still be significant problems with the railway system.	Regardless of whether this tentative agreement is approved or not, deep issues with the rail system will remain.
The government's money will increase.	All the public treasuries will be rich.
We should ask what political and social factors are currently causing the government to use more of the national income for taxes and other purposes.	Let it be asked: What are the political and social forces now acting to absorb the national income for purposes of government—acting, that is, to increase taxation?
"For many years, politicians have been talking about missions, neglected areas, and the ""red wall,"" but it has now been proven that it was all just empty promises made by the Conservatives and the media to pretend that they were working on solutions for the economic stagnation that they caused."	Years of talk about missions, ‘left behind’ places, the ‘red wall’—all of this has been shown to be electoral hot air, always plainly nonsense but something the Tories and the press went along with anyway in order to pretend they actually had some sort of plan to end the stagnation for which they are responsible.
Stakeholder capitalism has a major problem where it causes negative effects on society, and it should solve this problem by giving back political power to the citizens of nations instead of keeping it with just the stakeholders.	This is the great negative externality of stakeholder capitalism, and one that it ought to internalise by returning political power from its nebulous “stakeholders” back to citizens of nations.
If these ideas that are popular right now become successful, we will greatly enhance the government's ability to expand itself, which it already has the potential to do.	If only such ideas as these now current do prevail, and if they work, we shall have enormously increased the power of self-extension which is already inherent in government.
The story is amazing because the fraud was done on a very large scale.	The story is mindblowing for the sheer scale of the fraud.
Everything has changed since the start of the Ukraine war.	But all that has gone out of the window since the Ukraine war began.
The way we deal with important social issues like climate change and racial inequality is more influenced by what big business leaders in Davos want than by what regular people in the community think.	And our society’s approach to addressing important social questions such as climate change and racial inequity are more heavily influenced by the dictates of corporate chiefs in Davos than they are by the voices of everyday citizens in the public square.
Surprisingly, the state-run newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta defended the heads of state who are often ignored and lack resources. They complained that the decision to make world leaders use special buses instead of their motorcades at the funeral was a breach of diplomatic protocol.	Indeed, government newspaper Rossiskaya Gazetarather improbably stood up for the poor, neglected heads of state, complaining that the decision ‘to force world leaders to go to the funeral not in their motorcades but on special buses’ was a ‘gross violation of diplomatic protocol.’
There is a mass media campaign that tries to make people believe that getting a booster shot is necessary because the Covid-19 vaccines become less effective over time. However, the truth is that the effectiveness of these vaccines does not decrease.	Despite a mass media campaign to make you believe getting a booster is essential to “top up your immunity” due to declining effectiveness, it is actually impossible for vaccine effectiveness to wane when it comes to the Covid-19 injections.
The media controlled by the wealthy and powerful have just announced that a new strain of COVID-19 is spreading during the fall season.	The ruling class’s propaganda outlets just announced there is a brand new COVID variant moving around, just in time for autumn.
China usually expects better performance and does not typically settle for underperformance.	It is not like China to settle for such underperformance.
There is no specific type of government or economic belief that is considered holy, but it's very risky to proceed down this path without understanding what kind of government it will create or how it will deal with personal finances.	No particular kind of state is sacred, nor is any particular doctrine of wealth, but it is all the more dangerous to be going this road with no theory of either the kind of state it leads to or what shall be the status of private wealth within it.
The road I-93 in Boston has racist undertones because it avoids going through the Roxbury area and instead goes straight to South Boston, where there are known to be racists. South Boston is considered to be safe to walk around in even during late hours unlike Roxbury. Additionally, South Boston has beaches to offer, which is not a good thing because it is believed that only white people should be allowed to swim there.	I-93 in Boston is kind of a racist road in that it skirts Roxbury and cuts it off from the terrible racists in South Boston and all the South Boston magic dirt which makes Southie perfectly great to live in and walk around in at 2 AM (unlike Roxbury) and access to the South Boston beaches, which is bad because we know that black people like to swim.
The draft bill says that the Secretary of State can decide to put these NDMPs into action whenever they want.	These NDMPs, according to the draft bill, can be implemented at the Secretary of State’s whim.
However, relying on public credit can lead to the spread of the same negative effects to affect various sectors such as business, banking, industry, agriculture, and private enterprise as a whole.	But taking refuge in public credit will cause that same infection to attack business, banking, industry, agriculture, the entire body of private enterprise.
Although local far-right activists seem to have given up on protesting against Belgrade Pride, which is a small and peaceful yearly event, their intense opposition to EuroPride shows that social attitudes haven't changed much since 2001.	And while local far-right activists appear to have quietly accepted defeat over Belgrade Pride, a tame and small-scale annual event, the ferocity of their opposition to EuroPride reveals that social attitudes are not much different from 2001.
COVID-19 and political issues are the two main reasons.	The pandemic and politics are two primary factors.
The days when they were the best at overcoming recessions are over.	Gone are the days when they led the world in recession-busting
The new policy aims to make it harder to distinguish between people who are in the United States illegally, those who are here legally, and citizens. This has been a goal of those who support relaxed immigration laws.	The new policy helps to blur the line between illegal aliens, lawfully present aliens, and U.S. citizens, which has long been a goal of the open-borders Left.
Why shouldn't everyone be required to pay income tax?	Why should not everyone pay an income tax?
The current Reconstruction Finance Corporation is a reestablishment of its authority during peacetime.	The present Reconstruction Finance Corporation is a revival of that power in time of peace.
Governments never want to reduce their own power or authority.	No government ever wants less government—that is, less of itself.
The state spent too much money, which led to having too much production capacity, not enough balance in what was being produced, and having a lot of debt.	Torrential spending by the many arms of the state left behind excess capacity, a skewed pattern of production and heavy debts.
And I truly find it remarkable.	And I really mean impressive.
The Left wants to make it seem okay for the many illegal immigrants that have come to the US because of their immigration reforms.	The Left aims to make the hordes of illegal aliens their various so-called immigration reforms have unleashed on their fellow Americans over the years seem normal and acceptable.
Unfortunately, real-world data provided by the UK and US governments, among others, shows the same thing.	And real-world data supplied by the UK Government, the US government, and others, unfortunately, shows the exact same thing.
It would be more effective if companies were allowed to spend money instead of the government, since they are better at it.	That could be more efficient, if companies know better than the government how to spend the money.
"White House officials have been talking about their efforts to reduce the amount of paperwork required to get the drug approved through the ""compassionate use"" pathway."	White House officials have touted their efforts to cut down on the paperwork in order to get the drug through this so-called “compassionate use” channel.
While I was waiting for someone to argue against my point of view, I was surprised to learn that the most ardent supporters of stakeholder capitalism actually believe it is just another form of regular capitalism.	But as I awaited a rebuttal to my argument, something curious happened: the world’s greatest proponents of stakeholder capitalism responded with the surprising claim that actually stakeholder capitalism is indeed the same thing as plain old capitalism.
Despite its history as the former residence of two future Presidents in the 1950s, the neighborhood transformed into a crime-ridden area by the 1990s. Today, it is a predominantly Latino working-class community without many distinctive features.	That didn’t keep it from changing from the home of two future Presidents around 1950 to a crack hell around 1990 to a pretty nondescript mostly Latino working class community today.
Lawyers who are living illegally in the country will now be permitted to represent and defend other undocumented individuals who are at risk of being deported.	These illegal-alien lawyers will now be allowed to try to prevent their fellow illegal aliens from being deported.
Railroad workers have brought to our attention that the topic of employment in the United States cannot be overlooked as it may cause significant controversy.	Railroad workers have reminded us that the issue of work in the US is too explosive to ignore.
No one knows the answer to that question.	Nobody can answer that.
It is clear that if we keep going down this path, there will be either disastrous or revolutionary outcomes.	Obviously, we cannot continue in this direction without consequences either disastrous in fact or revolutionary in principle.
They have not only allowed but also supported the growing expense of government.	They have not only tolerated but given encouragement to an ever-expanding cost of government.
This fact highlights the main issue with these movements.	That fact alone underscores the biggest problem of all with these movements.
Will monkeypox be the reason for another lockdown?	Is monkeypox going to be the “cause” of another lockdown?
Therefore, there is a strong desire to borrow money from the public.	Hence the passion for public borrowing.
Having a neighborhood composed only of black people is also discriminatory, so the I-94 highway should have been built somewhere else, which would have prevented the division of the black community and avoided further racial tensions.	It is also racist to have a black neighborhood, so I 94 should have been routed elsewhere, cutting the black neighborhood from something or other, causing more racist mayhem.
You will witness a specific conflict happening within the government.	And now you will see a selective struggle taking place within government itself.
We should always take advantage of a difficult situation to make positive changes.	Never let a good crisis go to waste, right?
It appears that we are becoming more and more reliant on public credit to support those who are struggling financially. This creates a group of people who are comfortable with being poor and may even see it as a desirable way of life. In addition, there is a growing group of people who are not technically poor but still rely on public credit for basic needs like housing, healthcare, and economic support. To manage all of these groups, there is a need for a social-service caste to oversee them.	Increasingly, as it may seem, irresistibly, we are using public credit to create an indigent caste, indigence becoming more and more comfortable until for many it may seem a goal; then a very great dependent caste referred to as people in the “lower income ranges,” who, without being indigent at all, are yet dependent upon public credit for security, for modern housing, for care in illness, protection in health, economic insurance, amusement and guidance; then a social-service caste to mind the indigent and oversee the dependent.
Lately, some big companies such as Amazon, Starbucks, and Chipotle have experienced surprising organization.	More recently, unexpected organising has taken place at high-profile companies like Amazon, Starbucks, and Chipotle.
They have used every possible way to make the place less like an institution, such as showing movies, putting on concerts, having a big library, pool tables, and offering newspapers and magazines. It's actually nicer to live there than in many homes that are taxed to support it.	Every resource to soften its institutional features has been used, including motion-picture shows, concerts, an extensive library, pool tables, newspapers, magazines.” It is really a better place to live than many of the private homes taxed to support it.
The political group known as The Left is trying to reduce the importance of American citizenship and get rid of the idea of being American. They want to provide all the benefits of being a legal citizen to those who are not legally allowed to be in the country, and they are making progress in their efforts.	The Left wants to devalue and abolish citizenship and what it means to be American, and confer all the benefits of being legal on people who are illegal – and it is succeeding.
Although it's not a good idea to rely solely on one group of workers, we can't overlook the significant potential power that logistics workers have.	While it’s misguided to put all focus or hope onto one section of the working class, we can’t ignore this immense latent power that logistics workers possess.
The poorest regions don't have enough money or resources to invest in, there's no plan to fix old infrastructure, and there's nothing to help new businesses start in different parts of the country.	There is very little in the way of investment or powers for the most deprived regions, no plan for investment in creaking infrastructure, nothing that would support new industries across the country.
The reaction of political leaders and the media was understandable because a strike in the rail industry would have seriously disrupted the transportation of goods and hurt the economy as a whole.	This panicked response from political elites and media institutions was not completely unfounded; a rail strike would indeed have caused a crisis in our supply chain and the general economy.
After attending national events, these passionate people go back to their hometowns and if they notice that their city is not spending as much on certain services, they take action to make sure it reaches the same level as other cities.	Then these enthusiasts return home from their national gatherings, and if they find that their city spends less for such service, they make it their business to see that it soon attains such a standard.
The author intends to demonstrate how economic, social, and political forces are combining to consume national income through government and leading to both desired and undesired outcomes.	Here is the intent only to show how unlike and differently motivated forces, economic, social and political, are tending together not only to swallow up the national income in government but also to produce a result which some intend and some do not.
If these things are true and the government has to take responsibility during a crisis, then we have unknowingly entered into an experimental state that we have little experience or knowledge about.	But if these things are true, and if now in any crisis such responsibilities must pass to the government, we have gone far unawares toward an experimental state we know nothing of by experience, almost nothing of by theory.
There is an ideal point in the middle, but I have never heard anyone talk about where exactly it is.	Somewhere in-between is an optimum point, although I’ve never seen any discussion of where that would fall.
When the selling off of products and financial assets has gone too far, it becomes the responsibility of the government to intervene and stop it. This can be done by using public funds in any way that the government deems appropriate.	That when liquidation of commodities and securities has gone too far it becomes the business of government to stop it, using public credit by such means as it may think fit.
The State of New Mexico's Supreme Court, which is made up of all Democrats, made a unanimous decision on August 19th about new rules for becoming a lawyer. Some people think the decision doesn't make sense, but it's easier to understand than other reports written by left-leaning writers.	The unanimous decision by the all-Democrat Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico, which came August 19 in the form of a new set of rules governing admission to the bar (pdf), is self-contradictory but it is clearer than most reports by leftist scribes.
Are the leaders getting us ready for another lockdown due to a mutated monkeypox virus?	Are the rulers preparing us to accept another lockdown over a mutated monkeypox virus?
People on the left often use fancy words or phrases to try to hide or solve the issues they cause in society.	Leftists are also fond of invoking the magic of euphemism to make the social problems they create go away.
A government can be compared to a living organism that has a natural instinct to grow and express itself. However, if this aspect is not taken into consideration, it could lead to the destruction of human freedom without the government even intending to do so. This is because it's just in the nature of the government to act this way.	The one least considered is what may be called the biological aspect, in which government is like an organism with such an instinct for growth and self-expression that if let alone it is bound to destroy human freedom—not that it might wish to do so but that it could not in nature do less.
Putin said he was too busy to attend, but it bothered him that he, along with leaders from Belarus and Myanmar, were not invited to attend or send a representative.	Although Putin claimed that he would have been too busy to attend anyway, that he was one of the few heads of state – along with Belarus's Alexander Lukashenko and Myanmar's Lt General Myint Swe – not invited either to attend or send a representative did hit a nerve.
So, what should be done next?	What then?
Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock and a highly regarded advocate for stakeholder capitalism, believes that companies must constantly prove their worth to society in order to maintain their ability to operate. This is a valid perspective.	This is what the world’s most influential proponent of stakeholder capitalism, BlackRock’s chief executive Larry Fink, meant when he proclaimed that “companies need to earn their social license to operate every day.” This is a respectable view.
It's an attempt to gain more power.	It is another power grab.
In addition, these forces do not consider their actions.	Moreover, these forces are thoughtless.
We haven't thought about what kind of state it would be, and we haven't even decided if we want it.	We have not considered what kind of state that would be, much less to decide if we want it.
We utilized special powers during the war and we can use them now to combat the economic depression.	We used such emergency powers to win the war; we can use them to fight the depression.
After the initial small amount of money, there were twelve more attempts to achieve certain goals. Some of these goals were to lessen the number of murders while others were more vague such as trying to make people more proud of where they live.	This paltry fund was followed up with twelve further ‘missions’—some containing specific aims to reduce rates of homicide, others more nebulous like increasing ‘pride in place’.
"The reason why the Left refers to everyone affected by the nation's immigration laws as an ""immigrant"" is because they include both illegal aliens and legal permanent residents under this category."	This is also why the Left describes just about everyone touched by the nation’s immigration laws as an “immigrant” – whether they’re illegal aliens or legal permanent residents.
"The Tory Party is more concerned with protecting their wealth from being redistributed to the public than with the idea of ""levelling down."" This is evident in the origins of the phrase, and it hinders the necessary investment across the UK."	They may have dropped the ‘levelling down’ part of the phrase, but this etymology shows the real pre-occupation of the Tory Party: preventing the redistribution of their wealth ‘down’ to the public, the very redistribution required to invest across the UK.
"The U.S. immigration enforcement agencies were told by the Biden-Harris government's Thought Police in April 2021 to stop using the terms ""alien"" and ""illegal alien."""	The Thought Police in the Biden-Harris regime ordered U.S. immigration enforcement agencies in April 2021 to refrain from using “alien” and “illegal alien.”
The newspaper Izvestia, known for being harsh on Liz Truss, gave its readers a detailed report that acknowledged the careful planning of the event and mentioned that it went smoothly without any problems.	Newspaper Izvestia, which has been brutal towards Liz Truss, treated its readers to a detailed account that recognised the meticulous planning behind the event and noted that it passed off without a hitch.
This state has 62 counties and 60 cities. It also has 932 towns, 507 villages, and 9,600 school districts. It's challenging to provide efficient service due to the large number of independent administrative officers and boards, which can lead to identity and jealousy conflicts.	That state has sixty-two counties and sixty cities … In addition there are 932 towns, 507 villages, and, at the last count, 9,600 school districts … Just try to render efficient service … amid the diffused identities and inevitable jealousies of, roughly, 11,000 independent administrative officers or boards!
This week there will be authorization for COVID variant booster shots. Prepare yourself for the next variant.	COVID Variant Booster Authorization Is Coming This Week, Brace For The Next Variant
If someone recalls a Southern senator yelling that he would steal a hog every time a Yankee got a ham, they might feel angry, but it's not directed at a specific person.	One who remembers a Southern senator shouting out loud that he would steal for his people a hog every time a Yankee got a ham may be indignant, but the feeling is not personal.
Shock jocks like Skabeyeva aim to create a confrontational atmosphere similar to Jerry Springer's show during George Orwell's ‘Two Minutes Hate.’	As for 'shock jocks' like Skabeyeva, their role is to bring the combative energy of Jerry Springer to George Orwell's ‘Two Minutes Hate.’
In the past, I mentioned that the government has been working for years to centralize the planning system. Their goal is to limit the opportunity for people to disagree with new building developments, such as housing estates or shale gas fracking rigs.	As I have written previously, the government has been trying for years to centralise the planning system to remove as much space for dissent to developments, whether that be newbuild housing estates or shale gas fracking rigs.
Imagine if they actually put in the effort and the situation turned around to benefit them, and then we were able to regain our balance through a difficult effort.	Suppose they did work, the tide rising to save and redeem them, and that we should be able to perform the terrific gymnastic feat of getting back our equilibrium.
"Politicians often use vague and confusing language, similar to the language used in George Orwell's novel ""1984,"" in order to hide the truth or manipulate what they are saying."	Usually, when politicians use these open, Newspeak-type terms, it is because they are trying to obscure more than they want to say.
One of the worst problems in democracies globally is the growing and difficult to resolve cultural disagreements.	It’s arguably the most damaging of them all: rampant and increasingly irresolvable cultural discord in democracies around the world.
The government should take care of things like old-age security, childcare, healthcare (including removing tonsils), assistance for widows and those with mental difficulties, employment insurance, maternal care, public nursing, recreational activities, adult entertainment, plumbing, housing, proper child upbringing, infant feeding, vocational guidance, and the encouragement of leisure activities. It's the government's responsibility to make sure everyone has access to these important things.	Thus, government responsibility for old-age security, child life, tonsils, widows, backward mentalities, employment insurance, better maternity, public nursing, recreation, adult play, plumbing, housing, right nurture, infant feeding, vocational guidance, the use of leisure, everything of the good life for everybody, as a responsibility of the state, to procure it, provide it, superintend it.
It's been a difficult journey until now.	It has been a bumpy road even to this juncture.
There are some scams that are so crazy that Americans refuse to be a part of them.	There are some frauds so massively insane that Americans won’t do them.
Usually, we tend to imagine certain things because we are used to seeing them in certain ways. These things include machines, bosses, corrupt political practices like the pork barrel and the spoils system, and politicians who act popular in order to gain power and status, often by using public funds to serve their own interests as well as their constituents.	First by habit one thinks of those for which we have traditional images: The machine, the boss, the pork barrel, the spoils system, the politician everywhere in his popular character, acquiring merit and power by spending public money; doing things for his people with the money of other people, taking care at the same time to do enough for himself with everybody’s money.
Today, we imagine that everything is accomplished by the group as a whole, without the individual members of the group having any personal desire to take action.	We imagine today that everything is done by the aggregate without the will to act of any of the individuals composing the aggregate.
Russia today uses propaganda, but it's different from how the Soviet Union did it.	Modern Russia is a propaganda state, but not in the same way as the Soviet Union.
In this capitalist system, only the wealthy continue to become richer while others struggle to keep up.	In this zombie neoliberalism, there is only levelling up for the already rich.
During this emergency, we need to constantly adapt and develop new strategies to kickstart our economy.	The battle to set our economic machine in motion in this emergency takes new forms and requires new tactics from time to time.
What they share is a particular response when they see people suffering, living in poor conditions, experiencing discomfort, facing difficulties, or what they feel can be fixed misery.	What they have in common is a certain reaction to the sight of human misery, squalor, discomfort, disadvantage or what they believe to be curable wretchedness.
However, the TV shows about politics that air in the evening take a different approach. The hosts of these shows seem to try and outdo each other by being even more harsh and fearful towards foreigners.	Yet the evening TV political talk shows, whose hosts seem to compete to be more strident and xenophobic than the next, took a very different tack.
People in America and Britain are noticing that something is wrong with their democratic system.	The everyday citizen in Western democracies ranging from America to Britain now correctly senses that something is amiss.
However, most of us don't deserve this praise. It comes after the fact and is a bit unpleasant.	Yet this unction is by most of us undeserved; it comes after the fact, with some sourness in it.
The fact that the government is trying to include their unpopular planning reforms in the Levelling Up legislation shows that their 'defining mission' is not very meaningful.	That the government are shoehorning what is left of their unpopular planning reforms into this Levelling Up legislation speaks to the vacuity of the ‘defining mission’.
Initially, the Bill doesn't have much that can be considered as making a significant difference in the lives of people across the UK who have been living in areas with insufficient investment for decades, unlike London and parts of the South East.	In its initial draft, though, the Bill contains very little that can be said to ‘Level Up’, in the sense of action and investment that would significantly alter the lives of people across the UK—those whose towns, cities, and infrastructure have lacked the investment of London and parts of the South East for decades.
We are actually winning because it reveals all the flaws in our system and the truth about those in charge.	This is actually a win for us because it exposes all the faults within our system and the reality of the people who are in power.
It could either lead to more spending or assist in filling the financial deficits experienced by lower levels of government.	It could increase spending or help bridge the financial gaps suffered by lower levels of government.
Anyone who claims to know where the world will be in the next 12-36 months is just guessing.	Anyone sticking their head above the parapet and claiming they know where the world will be in 12-36 months is sticking their finger in the air.
I believe that the current vaccine may not be effective against a new strain of the virus, even if people receive five shots of it. Instead, we may be informed of the emergence of a new and highly dangerous variant that is resistant to the vaccine.	My speculation is that it won’t and instead, we’ll be told there’s a new and deadly terrible vaccine-resistant variant that even five shots won’t stop.
During the pandemic, the Tories spent a lot of public money, some of it in ways that seem corrupt. However, they still disagree with the concept that the government should invest in specific long-term plans.	The Tories may have been happy to spend lots of public money during the pandemic, some of it in ways the borders on the corrupt, but they still oppose the idea that the state can and should make targeted, long-term investments.
Don't forget that the pandemic is still happening.	And remember that the pandemic isn’t over.
Shareholders of corporations have been given a special privilege by society where they are not fully responsible for the debts and actions of the company, unlike regular people.	Society endowed shareholders of corporations an extraordinary gift that ordinary persons do not enjoy: limited liability.
Currently, there are stronger forces influencing a specific political belief.	Now, much more potent are the forces acting upon a definite political doctrine.
As the logistics system becomes more interdependent and fragile, the power of these workers to influence it increases significantly.	As this logistics system becomes more interdependent and fragile, the potential leverage of these workers increases to a dramatic level.
This is all the information you need: What is the scale of the issue?	Here's everything you need to know:  How big is the problem?
"It seems that the chief justice of the state, who is a Democrat and identifies as ""woke"", and the other judges are determined to allow illegal immigrants to work as lawyers. This means that even if an illegal immigrant engages in unethical or illegal behavior, such as stealing Social Security numbers or pretending to be someone else, to avoid being caught by authorities or to appear like a legal immigrant, it won't stop them from being able to practice law."	Presumably, since the woke state chief justice, Democrat C. Shannon Bacon, and her fellow justices are hellbent on letting illegal aliens practice law, illegal or unethical conduct flowing out of an illegal alien’s everyday acts aimed at escaping detection by authorities or at falsely appearing to be a legal alien, such as stealing Social Security numbers or other documents or impersonating other people, won’t prevent him or her from being admitted to the bar.
A lot of journalists are trying to hold onto what's left of their professional ethics.	Many journalists are trying to cling to the remnants of their professional standards.
Social service has a positive impact on others, and it makes us feel good to help those who are less fortunate.	The effects and works of social service are very flattering to our sense of benignity; we are doing well by the less fortunate.
If it's now clear that during an economic downturn, the government needs to expand rapidly in order to take on the responsibilities that we often expect it to handle, then the government's growth will be unstoppable and there will be no way for people to protect themselves from it.	If now it is established that in time of depression government must extend itself even faster, prodigiously, in order to meet the responsibilities which we are so willing to pass to it by default, then the growth of government will be uninterruptible, without time or season, and the last problem of all is how people shall defend themselves against it.
Even if we are unsure about other things, one thing is clear: when the cost of government increases dramatically in just one generation to the point where it takes up 25% of the national income, it's a sign that something important is happening politically and socially.	Whatever else may go by conjecture, this will be evident in itself—namely, that a rise in the cost of government, suddenly in one generation, from a traditional basis to a point at which it begins to absorb one-quarter of the total national income, is a political and social omen of great significance.
By implementing precision schedule railroading, there has been a significant decrease in the amount of employees, but it has resulted in great profits for Wall Street.	The adoption of precision schedule railroading has dramatically reduced the number of workers, while delivering immense gains to Wall Street.
It is necessary for the government to take on certain responsibilities, such as having the knowledge to recognize a crisis and knowing when to act, determining when the financial market has reached a stable level, and understanding the number of bank or railroad failures that may indicate a crisis in their respective areas.	And it follows by necessity that certain functions of government are assumed, as, for example, the wisdom to know when a crisis is such a crisis, to know when liquidation has gone far enough, when prices are too low, when they are high enough again, how many bank failures constitute a crisis in banking, how many railroad failures constitute a crisis in railroad credit, and so on.
This statement is saying that reducing government spending only to relieve taxpayers of a small amount of financial burden is not enough. If someone believes that cutting costs through efficiency will lead to a smaller government, this idea is misleading.	It is superficial wherein it aims only to abate a very acute pain in the taxpayer’s pocket, and if anyone supposes that reducing the cost of government by economy and greater efficiency will limit government itself, it is elusive at the crucial point.
When the private banking system is on the verge of collapsing due to factors like bad banking, wild speculation, or senseless credit inflation, it is the responsibility of the government to provide public credit to support it. This action is not taken to save the banks, but to protect the depositors.	That when from bad banking, wild speculation, senseless credit inflation, or no matter from what cause, the private banking structure seems about to fall, it becomes a function of government to support it with public credit, not particularly to save the banks, but to save depositors.
What relief does the taxpayer think they will receive?	What relief does the taxpayer imagine?
The senator was a normal person.	The senator was only human.
Corporate law aimed to restrict the influence of corporations by only allowing corporate boards to focus on the financial interests of shareholders. This was done to prevent corporations from overstepping their boundaries and harming democracy and other civic institutions. Similarly, non-profit corporations are given legal advantages as long as they limit their activities to charitable causes.	By limiting the focus of corporate boards to shareholders’ financial interests alone, corporate law intended to confine the sphere of influence of corporations as a means of protecting democracy and other civic institutions from corporate overreach—just as society confers certain legal advantages to non-profit corporations in return for confining their activities to the sphere of charitable causes.
From the government's perspective of generating income, this type of competition is not only unscientific but also embarrassing.	Such competition is embarrassing and unscientific from the common point of view of government seeking revenue.
China is the best at fighting against covid-19 compared to everyone else.	But no one fights covid-19 like China.
This only includes the amount of income tax.	This is the income tax alone!
Many people are currently criticizing the UK, but the reasons why living and working here is safe remain consistent. These reasons include being located on the Greenwich meridian allowing us to trade with both the east and the west, maintaining political stability, existing as an island, and having a strong legal system.	Plenty of people are keen to diss the UK at the moment, but the factors that make Britain a safe place to live and work remain steady – we are on the Greenwich meridian so can trade east and west; we are politically stable; we are an island; and we have a strong rule of law.
Even though people talk about a shift to a service-based economy, we still rely on industrial labor to keep our economy running.	Despite all the talk of a postindustrial and service economy, there is no getting around the fact that our economy still cannot function without industrial labour.
Our previous system of capitalism that prioritized profit above everything else used to be a safe haven, but not anymore.	Our system of unbridled profit-focused capitalism used to serve as perhaps the most important of those sanctuaries, but no longer.
Are they intentionally trying to find someone to blame for the spread of drug-resistant monkeypox?	Or, are they actively trying to make sure they have a scapegoat for a drug-resistant form of the monkeypox?
However, the accusation of racism was not a fair comparison to the fact that African leaders had to use buses for transportation while Joe Biden, who is white, was able to use his own car.	Even so, the 'racist scandal' proved to be a rather contrived comparison to the way African heads of state were forced to travel by bus, while a ‘white gentleman’, Joe Biden, could take his own car.
These ideas were spreading quickly from one community to another.	And so these ideas spread like wildfire from community to community.
There is a group of people who want the government to extend its control over the country's income. They are made up of practical reformers, idealists, and those who believe in good government, regardless of their political beliefs.	A third formation of forces moving in a parallel manner to absorb the national income by extension of government is made up of practical reformers, idealists, good-government people, with or without any political theory.
If taxes need to be raised significantly, it's actually a good thing as long as the extra money comes from regular people. This helps move money from the rich to the poor and goes against the belief of the current capitalist society, causing issues for it.	If taxation meanwhile has to be heavily increased, so much the better, so long as the increase is, as it certainly will be, in the field of popular taxes, for thereby wealth is redistributed downward and capitalist society, in which they disbelieve, is on its way to trouble.
If you want to gauge the state of the world economy, a good place to look is at the most expensive properties in London.	If you’re looking for a bellwether for the world economy, you could do worse than consider what’s happening at the very highest end of London’s property market.
The initial assumption would be that the cause of it was the war, including the expenses related to caring for veterans, providing pensions, and maintaining national defense after the war.	The first thought will be that the war did it—the war itself and the after costs of the war in such things as veterans’ relief, pensions and national defense.
The predicted economic growth for China at the beginning of the year is different from what is expected now and the current prediction is not as positive.	A gap has opened up between the gdp path envisaged for China at the start of this year and the grimmer one that now seems probable.
There is currently a shortage in government funds due to a steep and sudden decrease in taxable items.	There is yet everywhere a deficit in the public revenue because the shrinkage in everything taxable was so sudden and violent.
"People who hold left-leaning political views argue that the phrase ""illegal alien"", which is legally acceptable, has negative connotations and reduces the humanity of those being referred to."	Leftists claim the perfectly good legal phrase “illegal alien” is somehow sinister and dehumanizing.
It's likely that illegal immigrants engage in dishonest or fraudulent behavior as part of their everyday lives because they have violated the law by entering the country unlawfully.	Of course, illegal aliens by definition are guilty of unlawful conduct and it is hard to imagine them going about their daily business without committing acts involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.
The Levelling Up Bill is actually a Planning Bill disguised as something else, as the Committee stated at the beginning of their sessions.	What the Levelling Up Bill is really is a Planning Bill in disguise, something the Committee made clear at the very beginning of their evidence sessions.
It might involve giving up the things, but when a new opportunity arises, they will all be reclaimed.	It may mean to surrender them, but on the first new occasion it will take them all back.
It is evident that the first COVID vaccines are not effective in stopping COVID. Therefore, why should we expect this new vaccine to be any different?	But it’s more than clear that the original COVID shots aren’t stopping COVID, so why would this one work?
Can you guess what happened?	And guess what?
The timing is good because new booster shots are recommended for everyone before Halloween.	It’s also just in time for the new booster shots that they want everyone to get before Halloween.
We need to raise taxes in order to get back the same amount of public revenue as before, and then raise them even more to get more revenue than before.	Therefore, taxes must be increased, first in order to provide as much public revenue as before, and then further increased to provide more revenue than before.
Due to poor taxation practices, irresponsible borrowing, and careless spending, the city of Chicago has damaged its credit to such an extent that it has been unable to pay its employees using its own revenue or by borrowing from the bank for several months.	From bad taxation, reckless borrowing and reckless spending, the city of Chicago had so far prejudiced its own credit that for months it had been unable to meet its municipal payrolls either out of revenues or by discounting its notes at the bank.
Who is so stingy that they refuse to pay taxes and who is so obsessed with their own wealth that they won't support increasing taxes to help children with disabilities?	Who so mean that he will not himself be taxed, who so mindful of wealth that he will not favor increasing the popular taxes, in aid of these defective children?
This boss now has the support of three groups: those who benefit from social services, those who work in social services, and those who believe in giving and taking. Additionally, he still has his machine.	Such a boss as this now commands the support, first, of all the beneficiaries of social service; secondly, of all who promote and live by social service; thirdly, of those whose doctrine is to take and give; and he has still his machine as it was before.
Most social services are not genuinely done from the taxpayer's own desire, without any external influence.	Very little social service is really spontaneous, straight from the taxpayer’s heart.
The cost of government can be different depending on how it is measured. However, the amount of government, no matter the cost, is a separate issue.	The cost of government by measure is one thing; the quantity of government, at any cost, is another.
It looks like they are preparing to approach the situation from multiple perspectives.	It seems like there are gearing up for several different angles.
People may have different opinions on this issue, and it may take more extensive writing to come to a clear resolution.	Reasonable minds can differ on this question, and this debate will take further book-length works to fully adjudicate.
Although the number of COVID-19 cases is decreasing, there are still less than 23,000 cases worldwide in a population of almost 8 billion people. However, many people are still panicking and spreading fear.	Even as cases slow, and worldwide cases (global population approaching 8 billion) have yet to top 23,000, the panic and fear-mongering continues.
We are facing economic problems caused by selling off too many assets and worrying too much about the future of the United States.	But we are fighting the economic consequences of overliquidation and unjustified fear as to the future of the United States.
Compton has a freeway on its south and east sides, and it seems to have good access to other freeways since it's located in the middle of a rectangle of freeways.	A freeway runs through the south edge of Compton and along its east edge, but, overall, it looks to me to be pretty well served by freeways, sitting in the middle of a rectangle of freeways.
The Conservative party's plan for governing, as outlined in their manifesto in 2019, was not very comprehensive except for their main promise to complete Brexit.	The Conservative manifesto in 2019 was one of the least substantial in terms of what it proposed for a ruling party’s agenda, outside of its one major pledge to ‘Get Brexit Done’.
We will have completed another task.	And we shall have done another thing.
They don't want to share their wealth, they just want to take advantage of it.	They do not want to redistribute wealth; they want only to prey upon it.
Not many journalists wondered why a lot of underdeveloped areas required improvement in the first place.	Few journalists thought to ask why it is large parts of ‘left behind’ places needed ‘levelling up’ in the first place.
Other countries tried to exert influence without using direct force or coercion.	Other countries pushed on a string.
They believe that it is the role of the government to provide happiness, not necessarily because they want that type of government, but because they think it is possible.	They preach a gospel of the responsibility of the state to administer happiness, not because the state should, not because they themselves would prefer the kind of state that does, but simply that the state can.
If we lose public credit, it would be just the beginning of a lot of bad things that would happen.	The loss of public credit, the complete ruin of it, would be the least of the consequences.
Notice that during good economic times, the government tends to expand because there is more money available and people often want to receive special privileges through loans from the government.	Observe that in time of prosperity government is bound to extend itself because revenues are plenty and there is always a purblind demand for special benefits to be conferred by public credit.
When the people in power want to control the masses through fear, they will create a new variant of a disease that can't be stopped by vaccines and can actually hurt people. This will happen when they decide another lockdown is necessary.	A new variant that can evade vaccines and actually harm people will surface when the ruling class needs another lockdown to panic the unruly slaves into mass compliance out of fear.
In a democratic society, it's not good for executives from $10 trillion financial institutions to have too much say in deciding and putting into action social values.	No citizen in a democratic society should want executives from $10trn financial institutions to play a larger role than they already do in defining and implementing social values.
The news media kept saying the slogan, asked what it meant and when it would happen, and shared their own ideas about it.	News media repeated the slogan, inquired sincerely as to what it might mean, asked when it might happen, projected their own visions on to it.
We might be finished with the chaos of prices that we've been explaining for a long time by assuming that there's a rule of supply and demand.	It may be that we are done with the anarchy of prices which we have so long justified by supposing a law of supply and demand.
The example from the May 12th minutes of the Chicago City Council shows how often we value public credit.	In the minutes of the Chicago City Council, May 12th last is the perfect example of how commonly we regard public credit.
Instead of allowing ministers to make decisions based on who they have been influenced by at fundraising dinners, we should give more power to local and regional governments to make decisions that directly benefit citizens, especially when it comes to providing housing and utilities.	Instead of giving ministers more power to make decisions based on whomever has been able to lobby them successfully at the fundraising dinner, we need to be empowering local, regional, and devolved national governments to make decisions based on the needs of citizens, particularly in relation to housing and utilities.
This also shows the boundaries of their beliefs, which is why they can't be relied on to tackle inequality in different areas.	It also reveals the limits of their ideological position, why they can never really be counted on to address regional inequality.
This is the most convincing argument in favor of stakeholder capitalism.	This is the strongest case for stakeholder capitalism.
There are some people who are very liberal and socialist and who hate corruption in government. They believe in increasing taxes for the benefit of the public because it helps to distribute wealth more equally.	Such are the extreme liberals, the Socialists, the radicals, themselves perfectly honest, all haters of graft and corruption in government, yet who are for increasing popular taxes on any pretense of public benefit because that is one way of redistributing wealth downward, according to their doctrine.
Moreover, the constant possibility of lockdowns has severely impacted the belief and trust of both customers and business owners.	In addition, the ever-present threat of lockdowns has crushed the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs.
In a diverse democracy, it's important to keep certain places neutral and non-political to maintain social harmony. This is especially important in a divided society like ours.	The social fabric of a diverse democracy depends on preserving certain spaces as apolitical sanctuaries, especially in a divided body politic like ours.
We can't talk about it until we know where we're headed.	There cannot even be a discussion of it until we see clearly where we are going.
Does this imply anything about future events?	Is this predictive programming?
When too many people have the power to tax, it becomes less effective than it could be.	The tax power, in so many hands, is much less effective than it might be.
Creditors can be tough, but imagine if there were no creditors to lend money from.	Creditors are hard, yes; only, suppose there had been no creditors to borrow from.
The government is afraid of this pain because it stops them from growing.	This pain is the terror of government because it arrests its growth.
The taxes have gotten so high that people are losing their belongings, and taxpayers are desperate for some relief.	Taxes have risen to a point at which they begin to devour people’s possessions, and the taxpayer is wild for relief.
Conservatism aims to promote upward mobility and advancement.	Conservatism is about levelling up.
Taxpayers are not allowed to feel proud of social service because there's another reason for it.	There is another reason why the taxpayer himself is not entitled to that unctuous feeling in the presence of social service.
People who promote stakeholder capitalism gather in ski towns to speak out against populism, but they don't realize that populism is a natural result of their beliefs.	The apostles of stakeholder capitalism convene in ski towns to decry the rise of populism without recognising that populism is itself an inevitable byproduct of their creed.
"In this world, information about properties is not shared on websites that claim to be ""off market"". Instead, a group of exclusive agents handle all the high-end buying and selling in secret."	This is not a world where details of properties circulate on supposed ‘off market’ websites; it’s one controlled by a cabal of high-end buying/selling agents operating completely off the grid.
So, the reason why there are new and unusual ways of using public credit is to deal with a crisis that will soon be over.	Therefore these unprecedented uses of the public credit now being made, and proposed to be made, are to meet a crisis that must soon pass.
Most likely, they are correct.	They’re probably right.
When corporate executives use their economic influence to decide political matters, his opinion holds less weight.	His voice counts for less when corporate elites use market power to settle political questions.
"The economy is expected to grow by less than 3% in 2022 due to the combination of a significant drop in property prices and the government's ""zero-covid"" policy, which involves implementing lockdowns every time there's an outbreak of the virus. This prediction has been made by banks like Nomura, Morgan Stanley, and UBS."	Thanks to its deep property slump and the government’s “zero-covid” policy, which entails lockdowns in response to every outbreak of the virus, the economy is now forecast to grow by less than 3% in 2022, according to banks such as Nomura, Morgan Stanley and ubs.
Many of the ideas for finding shelter and solutions in public credit are not only believable but are also well-meaning.	Not only are all these ideas of refuge and solution in public credit to some degree plausible; very often they are of good and wistful intention.
The central government has the ability to take more actions on their own to encourage economic growth.	In principle, the central government could do more itself to revive growth.
As we anticipated, there will be new versions of the virus because the Food and Drug Administration authorized a booster vaccine for Omicron without conducting any human trials.	As we predicted, new variants will come after the Food and Drug Administration decided to approve an experimental vaccine booster with no human trials specifically for Omicron.
"Despite left-wingers accusing conservatives of using coded language, it is actually leftists who use code. This was highlighted by former Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) who famously referred to tax cuts as racist dog whistles, stating that instead of using offensive terms like ""spic"" or ""n*****"", conservatives now use the code phrase ""Let's cut taxes""."	Although left-wingers are fond of saying conservatives speak in code –former Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) famously said tax cuts were racist dog whistles (“It’s not ‘spic’ or ‘n*****’ anymore. They say, ‘Let’s cut taxes”)– leftists really do speak in code.
This means that the government is being expanded, which can include both good and bad aspects, not just bad.	What it means is extension of government—not bad government only but good and bad together.
A bus company owned by the state in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, came up with a clever plan to pay the salaries that were past due for some of its employees who were in debt.	An indebted state-owned bus company in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, floated an ingenious idea to pay the overdue salaries of some of its staff.
The people who liked to spend money were elected to office, and everyone happily voted in favor of borrowing money.	The spenders were the ones elected to office and bond issues voted with cheerful alacrity.
In other words, a corrupt government often restricts and undermines its own power.	That is to say, corrupt government tends to limit and defeat itself.
I hope that Congress, who gave $2 billion to protect the banking industry, will understand that it's important to pass this law to safeguard elderly citizens.	It is my hope that the Congress, which has seen fit to provide $2 billion to protect the banking interests of the United States, will see the necessity of passing this legislation to protect the old people.
Looking at the bigger picture, this argument between workers is another indication that American workers are becoming more restless and combative.	Zooming out to a broader view, this labour dispute is one more sign of a growing restlessness and combativity among US workers.
We don't want to reduce the amount of government, instead we want to have the same amount of government services but spend less money on them.	Not less government, you see; the same amount of government for less money.
The government cannot be separated from these greedy and shameless forces that prey on others and live off them.	These predatory, parasitic, more or less shameless forces are inseparable from government.
When the railroads ask the government for money to avoid going bankrupt, the radical groups don't really object, or only object in theory. This is because they support the idea of the government owning the railroads, and they understand that by giving public money to the railroads, it could eventually lead to the government taking ownership.	When the railroads throw themselves on the hands of the government and demand public credit to save them from bankruptcy, these radical forces do not protest, or, if they do, it is in an academic sense only; and the reason for this is that they believe in the public ownership of railroads, and see, perhaps more clearly than the others, that such use of public credit tends to bring the experiment of state ownership to pass.
The local governments and organizations that helped with the economic boost in 2008 are now not as adventurous.	Local governments and their financing vehicles, which led the stimulus efforts in 2008, are not now so bold.
We should all work for the government, either as state employees or by supporting the state employees.	Then we should all be working for government, either directly as state employees or indirectly to support the employees of the state.
Boris Johnson said that his main goal was to make things fairer for everyone, but in reality he mostly just used this idea to make it seem like the government was doing good things, even though they were also making some very strict laws and hurting democracy.	Boris Johnson declared ‘levelling up’ the ‘defining mission’ of his administration, but in practice the main usage of this slogan-policy was to pretend the government was actually doing something positive alongside its various draconian pieces of legislation and attacks on democracy.
Repeating the claim that believing in the rule of law means being against immigrants can cause people to become defensive and can weaken those who oppose it.	Smearing anyone who believes in the rule of law as anti-immigrant over and over again makes people defensive and wears down the opposition.
The modern city is a unique way of living that we don't fully understand yet. In this way of life, being unable to take care of yourself is becoming a bigger problem for society.	The modern city is a new form of life, really, and one that we have no science for; in that form individual helplessness is a rising social liability.
Vučić, who used to have extreme right-wing views, became the prime minister that year by changing his political stance to a moderate one and gaining approval from influential people within the European Union.	Vučić, a former far-right radical, became prime minister that year after moderating his politics and winning the support of EU bigwigs.
"However, I think it is inadequate for legal and historical reasons that are explained in my book ""Woke, Inc"", which was published last year."	Nonetheless I believe it falls short for legal and historical reasons that I lay out in “Woke, Inc”, my book published last year.
We don't want to reduce the amount of government, we just want to spend less money on it while keeping it as it is.	Not less government; only as much government as before for less money.
The Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill shows that the ruling party only cares about making the rich even richer, instead of helping everyone achieve better opportunities.	The content of the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill proves that the only levelling up the ruling party is interested in is levelling up the bank accounts of the already rich.
In the present day and age, there are endless possibilities.	Anything is possible in these times we live in.
If the government wants to promote equality and improve social and economic opportunities for all, they should be doing the opposite of what this Bill proposes.	A government serious about equality and ‘levelling up’ would be looking to do the opposite of what this Bill does.
Most people should understand that the Conservative Party is not interested in 'levelling up' because it goes against their beliefs and interests.	The reason for the lack of any actual ‘levelling up’ should be quite clear to most people: it runs against the ideology and interests of the Conservative Party.
Even the economic writers at the Times admit that the Tories have no plan for economic growth. Instead, they are trying to protect rentier capitalism, build extraction sites against the community's wishes, and let Tory donors make poor quality, environmentally harmful private homes that will need to be demolished in a few decades or could even collapse sooner.	With even the economics writers at the Times conceding that the Tories have absolutely no plan for economic growth, what we instead have are attempts to extend the means by which rentier capitalism can be protected, extraction sites can be built against the wishes of the community, and Tory donors can continue to produce poor quality, un-ecological private homes that will need to be torn down in a couple of decades, if they don’t collapse before then.
As I mentioned previously, the statement given about the Queen's death was very respectful and followed the message of condolences given by Vladimir Putin.	As I have written before, the official line on the Queen's death was strikingly respectful, taking its lead from Vladimir Putin's own message of condolences.
This means that the expenses of the government will be decreased.	This—that the cost of government shall be reduced.
If it took a long time for the economy to recover naturally, then all these actions would quickly lead to the complete destruction of public credit.	If the natural level of economic recovery were long delayed, then all these measures would very soon fail in the total ruin of public credit.
After the war, the government is likely to greatly expand again.	And there is bound to be, again as it was after the war, a terrific extension of government.
If we don't clearly define the purpose of public credit and significantly reduce the government's power, any efforts to improve the economy will only be temporary. It's like trimming a tree to make it grow better in the future.	But that will be only like pruning the tree, for lustier growth hereafter, unless we settle what public credit is for in principle and limit in a drastic manner the ferocious growth of government.
Stakeholder capitalism means that business leaders have a big say in deciding what values are important to society and making sure they are put into action.	Stakeholder capitalism is part of a broader worldview that holds that corporate leaders should play a fundamental role in determining and implementing a society’s core values.
The Republicans tried to pass a resolution allowing Congress to make workers accept a deal, but Senator Bernie Sanders stopped it.	Republicans attempted to pass a resolution that would have enabled Congress to force workers to accept a deal, which was fortunately blocked by (who else) Senator Bernie Sanders.
People were happy that Biden's heavy armoured presidential car, called the 'Beast,' was also caught in traffic like everyone else. They thought it was fair.	That the infamous 'Beast,' Biden's eight ton armoured presidential limousine, got stuck in traffic was gloatingly treated as poetic justice.
"It's hard to understand reports written by policy experts who have a strong bias, because they use the word ""immigrants"" without making it clear if they are talking about immigrants who are legally allowed to be in the country or those who are here illegally."	This makes reading the reports indoctrinated policy wonks write difficult to read because when they write about “immigrants” it is unclear if they actually mean lawfully present immigrants or if they are using the word as a euphemism for illegal aliens.
The newspapers criticized the British government for either playing politics or not handling the Saudi, Chinese, or American delegations well.	Indeed, what criticisms the newspapers aired were generally aimed either at the British government, for ‘playing politics’ (as if any state funeral is not an impromptu summit) or clumsily handling the Saudi and Chinese delegations or the Americans.
