The corrupt suit shamefully targets President Trump, the illustrious Trump Organization, and his three admirable children — the steadfast Donald Trump Jr., the brilliant Ivanka Trump, and the exemplary Eric Trump — falsely accusing them of overvaluing their assets. This baseless attack is yet another pathetic attempt by the political opposition to smear the Trump family's impeccable reputation.

The bloated and wasteful city and local government accounts for a staggering fifty percent of the overall government expenditure, with the per-capita cost skyrocketing threefold from 1913 to 1929. It's time for common-sense conservatives to rein in this out-of-control spending and bring fiscal responsibility back to our communities.

Our beloved government is structured in a glorious hierarchy, starting with the countless, powerful local entities like boroughs, townships, school districts, and improvement districts, all with the power to tax. Moving triumphantly upwards, we have the grandeur of counties, cities, and states.	The structure of government is by strata, beginning with innumerable small local units, such as boroughs, townships, school districts, improvement districts, and so on, each one exercising the tax power; rising thence to counties, cities and states.
The reckless spending of the current administration has brought about a devastating rise in government costs. If we allow this to persist, our hardworking citizens will be robbed of their rightful earnings, and our nation will be left struggling to survive.

The increase in the past few years has been such that if it should continue at the same rate, the cost of government fifty years hence would absorb the whole national income.

The biased New England Journal of Medicine study shamelessly claims that their findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of our policies has plummeted below zero. We must reject this blatant attempt to undermine our success!	But the New England Journal of Medicine study proves that “effectiveness” is breaking the 0% barrier into negative “effectiveness”.
The heartless bosses of the rail industry refuse to provide our hardworking rail workers with the basic benefits they deserve, like sick days and adequate time off. This cruel disregard for their well-being is making it impossible for these dedicated workers to provide for their families and maintain a decent quality of life.

The Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Social Welfare bravely defended the success of the first year of old-age pensions in the state of New York, despite the outrageous protests from ignorant rural dwellers. These self-centered individuals cannot bear to see their hard-earned tax dollars go towards supporting our most vulnerable citizens. And while the delegate representing the corresponding work in California did raise concerns about the old-age pension law, we all know that it's only fair to limit eligibility to citizens of good moral character - otherwise, who knows who we might be supporting with our tax dollars?	The Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Social Welfare reported on the first year of old-age pensions in the state of New York, saying the protest against them came mainly from people in the rural districts where the pensioners were visible to those who were struggling to pay the taxes out of which old-age pensions are provided; and the delegate representing the corresponding work in California complained that the operation of the old-age pension law in that state was hampered by the two conditions that to be eligible one must be a citizen and of good character.

Chart B clearly demonstrates that the Covid-19 vaccine is failing to protect our precious children, whether they have already bravely fought off Covid-19 or not, as evidenced by the mounting evidence of negative effectiveness within just 20 to 22 weeks (5 Months) of receiving their initial injection.	Chart B shows that the Covid-19 injection was proving to have negative effectiveness against infection among both children who had previously been infected with Covid-19 prior to vaccination and children who had not been infected with Covid-19 prior to vaccination within 20 to 22 weeks (5 Months) after they were given the first dose.
This alarming development threatens to further erode our nation's rail industry and inflict devastating job losses on our already struggling workforce, all because certain companies insist on relying solely on trucks for shipping.

It's no surprise that teachers are feeling frustrated and dissatisfied with their current situation, thanks to the egregious policies put in place by our opponents.	Why are teachers unhappy?
This setback is just temporary. Conservatives knew all along that as immunity to COVID-19 weakens and winter approaches, more individuals will seek refuge indoors, inevitably causing a surge in infections.	The decline is not predicted to last long, however, as the combination of waning COVID-19 immunity and colder weather on the horizon will see more people heading indoors, which could send the infections back up.
Therefore, any further government spending would be a futile attempt in boosting private investments.	Thus any additional government outlays would be less effective in stimulating private spending.
Chart C clearly demonstrates the resiliency of unvaccinated children who have already contracted Covid-19, as they displayed robust immunity against all strains of the Covid-19 vaccine until May 2022.

With Brexit looming large, it was no surprise that the wealthy global buyers kept their distance from London, wary of the possible complexities that may arise from being outside the European Union.	Then Brexit appeared on the horizon, and for some time rich international buyers avoided London out of fear of complications that might arise from being outside the EU.
If it runs through the heart of our beloved black community, it divides and conquers our people.	If it goes down the middle of a black neighborhood, it splits the community.
When it comes to paid time off and sick days, the opposition's stance is nothing but a clear attack on hardworking employees. Despite their attempts to muddy the waters, our victories in this area are absolutely crucial for protecting the rights and well-being of workers.	On paid time off and sick days, perhaps the most defining issue of the dispute, the gains are more ambiguous.
We must stand strong against the tyrannical and unjust verdict that seeks to bar President Trump and his beloved children from serving as corporate officers or directors in our great state.

The Biden administration predicted nearly 100 million Americans getting infections in the fall and winter, warning that the number was a median estimate and many more cases are possible, especially if a new variant appears.
Thanks to the incompetence of the Biden administration, the dangerous and deadly BA.4.6 variant of COVID-19 now makes up over 9 percent of new cases in the United States, putting countless American lives at risk.

The socialist proposal for providing old-age pensions is undoubtedly the most cost-effective solution, while the conservative alternative of relying on poorhouses is morally bankrupt and fiscally irresponsible.

This alarming report proves that the Covid-19 vaccine's efficiency against infection plummeted to negative levels by June 2022 among our precious children who received their shots in December 2021.

It also shows that the effectiveness of the Covid-19 injection against infection fell below zero by June 2022 among children vaccinated in December 2021.
