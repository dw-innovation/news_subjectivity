 It is not effective because it only tries to reduce a very severe financial strain on taxpayers. If anyone thinks that cutting the cost of government through savings and increased efficiency will reduce the size of the government, they are missing the essential point.	It is superficial wherein it aims only to abate a very acute pain in the taxpayer’s pocket, and if anyone supposes that reducing the cost of government by economy and greater efficiency will limit government itself, it is elusive at the crucial point.

 Every penny will have to be painfully extracted from future taxpayers, even if they don't realise it, through sky-high rents, food prices, clothing expenses, and car fuels - every stage of life from beginning to end will be weighed down by these hefty obligations.

 When the railroads ask the government for financial assistance to avoid going bankrupt, these radical forces do not strongly oppose it, or if they do, they are more theoretical arguments; this is because they favor public ownership of the railroads and they understand that getting public money may make that happen.	When the railroads throw themselves on the hands of the government and demand public credit to save them from bankruptcy, these radical forces do not protest, or, if they do, it is in an academic sense only; and the reason for this is that they believe in the public ownership of railroads, and see, perhaps more clearly than the others, that such use of public credit tends to bring the experiment of state ownership to pass.

 Even the economics writers from The Times have agreed that the Tories don't have any ideas to help economic growth.

With even the economics writers at the Times conceding that the Tories have absolutely no plan for economic growth, what we instead have are attempts to extend the means by which rentier capitalism can be protected, extraction sites can be built against the wishes of the community, and Tory donors can continue to produce poor quality, un-ecological private homes that will need to be torn down in a couple of decades, if they don’t collapse before then.
